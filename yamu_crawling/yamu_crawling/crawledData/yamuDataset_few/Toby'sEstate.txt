name: Toby's Estate 
excerpt: Toby's Estate in Mount Lavinia is a very cosy hangout that serves okay-food that's a little on the pricey side - this international franchise is still best known in Colombo as a coffee stop rather than for its dine-in.

The atmosphere was set to please and the writer of this column needs to try and open a cafe and get it right in 2 days…I have done it and believe these guys will satisfy give it a go and don't be turned off by restaurant critics who have never experienced the hot seat!

I checked out Toby's a month back. Went there to surf the net and grab some coffee. Unfortunately the Wi-Fi connections weren't set up but it got me chatting with one of the co-owners of the space. It was lovely talking to him and  he showed me around the place.  ", '\r\n', '\r\nI thought interior-wise, some of the spaces was a bit too cramped up for my taste. Though there were lovely touches such as the sitting area near the garden. If they were serving alcohol, this would be one place I would be visiting more often, because of its charming out door sitting area. ', '\r\nI did grab lunch and coffee. Food and coffee were both not up to par. The prices for the items were a bit on the high scale. Almost all entrée on the menu were around 800 and above. Service was good, and the guys there were attentive towards my needs.', '\r\n', "\r\nOn hindsight I might be being a bit critical, since they have just started out. I would be checking the place out more often cos I live around that area and Im glad that there's a coffee shop I can go to for my java fix.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I've visited the place and it's beautiful.The interior is relaxing and I liked the mixture of different spaces, indoor and outdoor seating etc. The staff is friendly and I liked my coffee. Definitely among my favorite cafes in Colombo \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Coffee is good but the cups are rather small for the prices charged.  The food needs work.  It's not bad, but it's not good enough to keep me coming back.  I'll check back with them in another month to see what I find then.  \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Not very good value for what you get.  The place is fancy but what good is that if the food is very ordinary.  I hope they improve on the food.  Some pastries are even worse than what you get in the local kade for a fraction of the price.  \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Interesting review\'s. I write whilst at Toby\'s on their WiFi. I was surprised at the comment on the price of Entree\'s. I quickly called for the menu again to double check whether I had made a mistake. "Wish" has got it wrong, the most expensive Entree is Rs. 400 net and the Cheapest at Rs. 200 net. I had a Calypso coconut Shrimp with Honey Rum Sauce (entree Rs. 400 net) and the Chicken & Mushroom Risotto (main Rs. 1,200 net). The food was really really really good. Had a flat white to wash it down. The coffee is out of this world. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Ryann, there can be a great deal of confusion over what the word "entrée" means.  Many use the word to describe the main course of a meal and I took that to be what the poster Wish meant. You obviously use it to mean the appetizer or starter.   ', '\r\nI do agree with Wish in that I too find the price of main courses at Toby\'s to be on the high side when one considers the small portions.  There is no question that the price of their coffees is also high when you consider the small cups they are served in.  They seem to be too obsessed with "portion control".  I like my meals and drinks to look generous.  Those served at Toby\'s are skimpy at best.  \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Went there the day before after a friend told me it had the best coffee (and making sure I read this review beforehand of course!). The coffee WAS good but, as another commenter had mentioned earlier, they need to have bigger cups! The staff were super friendly and eager but not very competent. I ordered a starter and it came without cutlery or serviettes etc. It also wasn't very good (the battered mushroom). But with that attitude they just need to work on the basics so that's positive. As for the food…dunno, maybe hire a new chef?\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I may be wrong about this but i understand that one of the main selling points of Toby's Estate is that they use responsibly sourced coffee beans purchased directly from farmers across the world or something like that. ", '\r\n', '\r\nWhilst very likely having no impact on flavour and probably sending prices a little steeper i think they ought to be given some credit for it if that same process applies to their Sri Lankan franchise. Pretty glaring error to leave that out if so.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    i was there two days in a row and everything was just great! The place is spacious and our kids had plenty of space to run around, the staff is an absolutely refreshing change from any other coffee place I've been to in Colombo (but i agree with you,  A new broom sweeps clean, so hopefully they will be consistent) so far we've tried their crispy fried calamari, grilled jumbo shrimp, spicy BBQ pork & chicken penne from their menu, and they were all yum! The mocha frappe was good as well! Their desserts could use a little improvement though… I think it's a really great place and im glad i dont have to drive all the way to colombo to get a good cup of coffee now! \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    had lunch today, excellent service, good prices, the Chennai Seafood Curry was just great as were the sandwiches, recommend a trip to all - coffee not tried as yet, gets a Thumbs up from me - will be there again\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I had dinner here once and the food was absolutely fantastic!!!
