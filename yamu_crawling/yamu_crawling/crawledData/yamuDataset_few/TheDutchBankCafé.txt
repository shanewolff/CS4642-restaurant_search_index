Only thing are the frikkadels and not sure they r genuine either. So it\'s your average cafe scene with the usual suspects like Nasi Goreng etc. Taste wise not the best - we tried the frikkadels & the "authentic" nasi goreng! Place is not cheap either - about 2k per head!', '\n\n                                    ', '\n                                            The food is not at all good. We had a pizza marinara which didnt taste at all like marinara. We also had the thai red curry wuich basically tasted like a sri lankan curry with some lemongrass in it. They also served a grilled seer fosh with something that was like string hoppers and again it was absolutely tasteless.', '\r\n\n                                    ']
