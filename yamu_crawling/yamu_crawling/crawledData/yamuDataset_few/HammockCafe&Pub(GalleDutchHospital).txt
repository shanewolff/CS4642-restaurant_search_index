I dont even understand whats the point of having a restaurant in Sri Lanka if you cannot make a proper deviled chicken and a fried rice. Even a road side street shop offers better deviled portions. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    novelty of hammocks wears off quickly here! and restricts you to two per table unless you go inside glad we didnt order from here or stick around! there are few places you can enjoy a beer outside at the dutch hospital in galle - we enjoyed the tuk place a lot given the views and excellent service and food!\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Fantastic food and service and the staff are incredibly hospitable. It's a must if any travellers are passing through Galle! \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Was here about a month or so back. Worst food and service ever. We ordered the kottu which was stale and oddly sticky.  Their iced tea is absolutely unpalatable - way too strong and too acidic. I returned the iced tea and still got charged for it. The waiter offered no apology for the inferior food and beverage and looked incredulous when I returned the drink.  Service is slow - approx 30 mins for 4 drinks to come. One of which was a coke. Owners if you are reading, its your loss if you dont do something about the service and the quality of food. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I bought club sandwich. Wost i ever had. Very small portion and only few ingredients.Not recommend\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    wost spelling too\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Don't let the looks of it fool you!!!!", '\n', "\nAbsolutely no taste in the selection of music. They believe Bieber is the way to go with a bit of Hindi after which killed the vibe… The music was so loud that the waiter couldn't even hear our order. They were too stubborn to bring the volume down. ", '\nThe food took forever to come even though there were very few people at the restaurant. Non of which we ordered would have passed the standard of a normal street shop in the town. ', '\nKottu is not meant to be served with KETCHUP and neither is the Nasi Goreng. They also refused to serve us gravy to swallow the dry kottu. ', "\nEven though the manager was polite enough not to charge for the Kottu, I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time and money on a place like this……\n                                            "]
