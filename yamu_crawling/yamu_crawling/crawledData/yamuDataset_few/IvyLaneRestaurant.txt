name: Ivy Lane Restaurant
excerpt: A tiny restaurant that serves up lunch and dinner, with a Sri Lankan and Indian menu.
yamu_review: ["Ivy Lane Colombo has joined the ranks of the Colombo city hostels.\xa0It's supposedly related to the Clock Inn. Adjoining the hostel is their restaurant, which is\xa0open for lunch and dinner and serves both Sri Lankan and Indian food. I dropped in for lunch and had a pretty mediocre experience.", "The menu at Ivy Lane offers Sri Lankan rice and curry and mostly Indian fare. They've got soup, salad, biriyani, fried rice, noodles, parata and kottu. For sides, you can order mutton, beef, chicken, fish, prawns, crab, cuttlefish, egg or go vegetarian. For lunch, they've got a set menu, so I tried the\xa0VIP set menu (Rs 300).", "It took 20 minutes for the food to get to the table, and by then the rice was barely warm. The chop suey wasn't very palatable, and the chicken was quite dry. Overall, this was a bit disappointing but there's enough for two people. It also comes with a sweet and sour chili sauce.", "For sides, I got the Chicken 65 (Rs 490) and Mutton Kadai (Rs 700). I was disappointed that it wasn't a real Chicken 65. It's not a difficult dish to accomplish, really, so either they don't know how to make it or just don't care. What I got was some fried chicken with a pretty unremarkable sauce. ", "The mutton kadai, though, was fragrant and yummy. You get plenty of mutton and the curry has got a lovely tang to it. It's not too spicy and the coriander leaves give it a nice kick. The meat itself was soft but also quite fatty, though, so if you don't like that, this may not be for you.\xa0", 'I also got a sweet lassi (Rs 180) to wash it down and this arrived well before the food. It just tasted like the yoghurt drinks you can get at any grocery store. A little too sweet for my liking, and not too thick.\xa0', "The space at Ivy Lane is tiny. You could barely fit 10 people in there. I couldn't really feel the A/C at work, but there are fans, so it doesn't get too hot.", "Service is mostly handled by a kid who looks about 14. They don't really interact with you, so you have to go up to them and place your order. If you sat down and said nothing, they won't bring you a menu.\xa0", "Ivy Lane Restaurant is alright if you want take-out or work around the area. Their rice and curry lunch is reasonably priced at under Rs 200 for chicken, fish or egg. Their Indian fare is neither here nor there, so we wouldn't really consider them a place to go for Indian food.\xa0"]

user_comments: ["\n\n                                    I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone. The lunch I bought there, had a karapoththa (cockroach) inside it, and when I went back to return it to them, they never bothered, and I called the person who was at the reception taking orders and I said I want to talk to him, and he never bothered and  I had to shout out that there was a cockroach inside, and when I shouted he was very cool and asked whether to give another rice packet, I just asked to refund my money and came back pissed off. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Well i have being working at Ivy Lane and we used to have lunch, dinner there, the main chef guy is Vidya,  they do sawan which can serves for 10 people, i know this post and reviews doesnt look good, but i have being working with these guys! very friendly, just speak to vidya, he will set you up with anything! they do have a roof top terrance too, if you request they will serve the food there too!  \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Well , as I'm working nearby we used to visit this place daily for our lunch. This is the only place in this area where you can have a decent lunch . Mac is nearby but you  have very limited choice. But at Ivy you can get a very good variety of dishes from Sri Lankan , Indian to Chinese. ", '\r\nI  agree with some of the comments such as place is very tiny and you have to reach them to place your order. That is mainly due to the place is very small and not much room to move around. Especially at lunch time place is crowded and guys working at ivy cannot reach tables as the crowd is gathered at the counter until they get their take away. Avoid lunch time (12.30 pm - 2.30pm ) , they are open till 3.30pm for lunch . Generally after 2.00pm the place is not so crowded. But after 1.30pm it is very unlikely that you can order Sri Lankan , rice & curry as the demand for it is very high. ', "\r\nIvy Chef  Vidya ,  is a wonderful character . Always wants to give the best for his customers . Unfortunately some times he is not to be seen in the picture as he's stuck with work at the underground kitchen. ", '\r\nIf you visit the place in evening it is completely opposite of what you experience at lunch time. Place is not so crowded and lot more peace and calm is there and can enjoy a lovely dinner. Try their butter Naan with Chicken Masala or with Mutton Kuruma or eve with Paneer. They taste awesome . ', '\r\nAsk for special Chicken Cheese Kottu from Vidya , you will never go to any place to eat Kottu. Fish fried rice is also fantastic. As commented in this post their Sawan is well worth for money . It can serve 10 people easily. I highly recommend this place for dinner or lunch. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Ate here last Thursday, and felt the ambience, price, taste and size were all excellent. I remember ordering a fried noodles with chicken. \n                                            ']
