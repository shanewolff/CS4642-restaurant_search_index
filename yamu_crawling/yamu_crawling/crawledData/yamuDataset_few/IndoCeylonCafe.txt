excerpt: Their coconut chutney lifts to high heavens an otherwise mediocre array of South Indian staples.
yamu_review: ["These days, you don't find a lot of ", ' that serve up authentic food.

With the right balance of sour, sweet and chilli, this\xa0condiment from heaven will put your ", " to shame. If you have it on its own, you'll first taste the lime, then the sweet coconut, and finally be left with the heat of the chilli. Just... beautiful.", 'Second, the ', " (Rs. 50)\xa0is quite large and packs quite a lot of potato in it. The filling isn't too flavourful, which is a letdown, but\xa0once again, it's more enjoyable with the coconut chutney. And third, the masala ", ' (Rs. 45)\xa0was just plain stale.

Given that this is a high-volume ', ", they don't seem to let their dosa mixture ferment for too long, so you don't get those tangy notes that make for a ", 'dosa.\xa0The masala was so off-putting. It tasted dark and muddied, with mostly the taste of mustard seeds and stale curry mix. We wished we had gone for a simple, plain dosa\xa0instead, and had no option but to leave without finishing our food.', 'The other saving grace was the Island Coffee that is served here.\xa0I had the milk coffee (Rs. 65), which was just\xa0sweet enough to not overpower the taste of coffee, and reminded me of the filter ', 'in Chennai, which was unexpected and quite comforting.', 'Indo Ceylon Cafe has the typical ambience of a ', ", with bright white lights and stainless steel plates. It's quite a contrast to the other eateries around this part of Kollupitiya. Service is quick but not very considerate.
