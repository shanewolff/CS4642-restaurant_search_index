name: Fortune Boat
excerpt: Fortune Boat was a wonderful find. It's a Chinese restaurant, hidden just off Independence Square near the newly refurbished Colombo Racecourse. You'd never spot it unless you happened to be walking round there.

user_comments: ["\n\n                                    I haven't been here in over a year, but the food was definitely great, though service was a bit slow and disorganised back then. hopefully the latter's improved. Also, their food will certainly put paid to the myth that genuine Chinese food is bland and lacking in spiciness!\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Don't eat outside, unless you're prepared to fight off the cute ducks with your menus.

If so LMAO!!!!\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Thanks for the info. I haven't come across this place before. Will certainly give it a try.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Does the map on the top-right shows the correct place? I went looking for it but didn't find it. Can someone give me directions please?\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I visited this place in late 2010, i found this place expensive, disorganized, and did not think much of their food, i remember the staff mucked up my bill and it was rectified later, never visited the place since then. Hopefully things have improved since then, the Chinese couple who runs the place used to have a small place in Braybrooke place, Col -02 right opposite the Janashakthi car park, this must have been 2005-07 period, they used to have good takeaway packets. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    The map is wrong. It's one block to the left. I was here about a year ago last and I remember having to constantly fight the flies that kept tasting the dishes.

Visited the place several times before that as the food was good. However, back then it was totally disorganized, poor service, and on several occasions we were billed for items we did not have.

Especially the noodles with shredded pork and green beans served two hearty eaters and was delectable. However, there was a 12% government tax charged in addition to the 10% service charge. That was a total rip-off!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Don\'t touch this place with a barge pole - our experience of the place was disastrous. We went there on 8th August and it turned out to be the most disappointing Chinese meal I have ever had. The "Green Chilli Peppers" turned out to be nothing but common or garden  capsicums in an unappetizing presentation. The chicken in the "Chicken with Chilli" was burnt to a cinder and resembled tiny bits of burnt firewood. The manager and staff were very apologetic while admitting that it was over-fried and replaced it with a fresh dish of it which was marginally better but still very dry and inedible, with 70% of the dish being dried chillies. The steamed rice was just boiled white rice and nothing like steamed rice that is normally served in a decent Chinese restaurant. The "Pork Noodles" was somewhat edible but also below par for the high price. The manager admitted that things often go due to the difficulty in communicating with the Chinese management. Almost all of what we\'d ordered remained uneaten. All in all, one huge disappointment, and a pricey one at that!           \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Absolute pathetic \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    This is the worsted recommendation we found on yamu.lk it is not a wonderful find and the food is not good. ', '\n', '\nIn fact the food was AWEFUL AND WATERY and COMPLETELY OVERPRICED.  The food had no taste…For a dish of pork belly (which had more tofu and pork fat in it), a disgusting watery tiny rice plate and devilled prawns we were charged over 4200 rupees for two ppl.
