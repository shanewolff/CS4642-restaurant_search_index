excerpt: It was with some delight that I heard tales of the Crab Company - the man behind the king of 90's Colombo restaurant Don Stanelys, now delivering export quality crab to your door. Every crab junkies dream - the stuff you want delivered, by someone reliable.

Real pity because the food is actually good but experience is ruined by the surprising incompetence of an inefficient, disorganized and indifferent management.', '\r\n', "\r\nRecently had a order of 3kg's SL style, 1kg Thai Pepper, and 2 portions of Kiri Cos for a dinner with friends. ", '\r\nGiven that the friends were SL folks visiting from abroad, i gave the order 4 days in advance so as to give lead time for CC to plan and purchase accordingly. Should make the logistics and planning and easy for them.', '\r\n', "\r\nWhat really had me worried was that i asked for confirmation of my order (after initially calling in the order by voice, but also texted the mobile hotline, which didn't fail to send me generic advertising updates)- and i didn't get any response for 2 days…and that, was after i had given missed calls and numerous texts. I almost had decided to look elsewhere because i wasn't getting any confirmation or response from them…but i finally did response on the 2nd day.", '\r\nThey buy crab on the day of the delivery, so i was going to know my final bill only on that day- however i had little confidence and it was unnerving, particularly given how they were responding up to this point.', "\r\nThe lack of customer relationship/service management had me fearing the worst, although i was told to give them the SL-style 'benefit of the doubt'.", '\r\n', '\r\nAs anticipated, the delivery was complete MUCK-UP by Crab Company (would like to use a stronger word there actually)', '\r\n', '\r\nI had asked for the delivery at 7.30pm and called around 5.30pm on the day of to confirm that the food was to be delivered on time. It apparently was going to be on time he said.', '\r\nNothing arrived at 7.30- I had called to see if the food was on the way and it apparently was. ', '\r\nNothing at 7.45, or 8pm. I called again at 8 and the response was that the food was 10 minutes away. I tried calling after 8.30, and at this point, no one answered my calls. No calls were made by Crab Company to me either.', '\r\n', '\r\nThe food finally showed up at 9.30. No calls, messages, or reasons were given for it being 2 hours late. Just an unfortunate delivery chap who had to dumbly stand there when asked why the delivery was 2 hours late.', '\r\n', "\r\nIt's a real pity because the food was actually came temperature hot and was very well made and tasty- but the indifference and bugger-up customer service by Crab Company coupled with the stress as a host dealing with no (not to mention hungry visitors who were looking to be done with dinner early!) meant the whole experience was in shambles. ", '\r\n', '\r\nWhat is surprising is that this is supposed to be an operation run by the former Don Stanleys folks but it must only be in name though, because this felt very much an amateur operation with no concept of customer service or simple communication skills.

I made a booking for delivery about 5 days in advance,  for 2 portions of baked crab and the carb feed for six people - crab feed as the website said, had to include Murunga crab,  rice or stringhoppers, kiri Kos, Pol sambol and Dhal. The food arrived in time and I was perfectly happy. But when I was transferring the curries into my dishes from the tin foil packages, I realised that they had not sent the Kiri kos. ', "\r\nAfter a frantic call, I was assured that they will send the said item. However I had to wait quite some time for it to come, even after my guests had arrived. I think they just FORGOT to include it,which is not really good. or………Don't know if due to the fact that I was a first time customer they thought I wouln't notice. \n                                            "]
