They have a great breakfast spread in addition to stringhoppers that alternates between milk rice, red rice, various pulses and pol roti. And they have Milo and other drinks. And special mention needs to be made of their lunch packets. Lots of local vegetables and generous portions. And most of all, you forgot to mention the prices of the items. Eatrite is very easy on the pocket.', '\r\n', "\r\nI'm a huge fan of YAMU and use it very often to find new places but maybe outsourcing reviews is not the best thing to do if you want to retain the quality of your content. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Eatrite has the healthiest and most value for money take away rice packets i've ever seen. Kehel kole rice with a karawala badun, chicken, 2 curries + green leaves for 120rs if i remember right. It does not taste of ajino-moto and thats a plus. You actually get the nice flavours of the foods. Only problem is that i find it a bit too salty maybe because of the karawala badun they supply. But its really greatâ€¦so are their wandu appa, asmee halapa and pol cake. Give it a try. Remember to get their rice and curry not the susiko's fried rice which they serve also.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Yamu really should review this place again. I happened to go this place for breakfast one time and it was fantastic. They had string hoppers, roti and others with many curries. All of them tasted fabulous. ', '\r\n', '\r\nThey have short eats too, but they are nothing special and are taste very ordinary. People should  definitely try their breakfast and lunch menu. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Does anyone know if they serve kola kenda in the morning? \n                                            ']
