name: Red Fort Restaurant
excerpt: Red Fort Restaurant is a small North Indian Restaurant on a small side road just off Baseline Road. The restaurant looks like an old abandoned house with wild grass and a kid’s playground at the front. The place is quite small but the service here is good and all in all, it’s a quaint, comfy place to have a meal.
