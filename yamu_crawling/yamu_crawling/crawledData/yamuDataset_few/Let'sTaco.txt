name: Let's Taco
excerpt: Colombo's first dedicated taco spot!
yamu_review: ["Five months after it's opening, Let's Taco is still setting an example for good tex-mex in Sri Lanka. It certainly hits places like Taco Bell out of the cricket stadium, but for a slight\xa0price premium. Be warned though, parking won't be the easiest to find here on busy days.", 'We started off with a small plate of Nachos (Rs. 900), the quantity of which was easily a full meal. The homemade nachos are mixed in with jalapenos,\xa0onion, tomato, cheese dip and\xa0avocado with a dose of lime providing seasoning.', 'The flavors mix in as you proceed to eat this messy dish, and by the end, what started off as something\xa0bland is\xa0a smorgasbord of creamy,\xa0spicy sensations.\xa0', 'Mixing and matching flavors is also what you have to do when you prepare your tacos.\xa0We picked the Siraccha Black Pepper Beef (Rs. 1,300). It came with guacamole and salsa sauce, as well as butter corn on the side. \u200b', "The siraccha and pepper didn't compete for power, and the beef was in the end a democractic mix of tangy and peppery spices, a great overall combination that hit a six (yes, cricket metaphors are in for this post) when combined with the guacamole and salsa. Five stars.\xa0", 'We tried one of the homemade drinks, Zingy Orange (Rs.350), but it basically tasted like a variation of Orange Barley,\xa0and\xa0a little too sweet. The Mango Shake (Rs. 450) was a little steeply priced for its\xa0quantity, but tasted better.', "The service was exceptional.\xa0Our waiter Nuwantha\xa0knew the menu inside out and wasn't afraid to give recommendations, all of which (at least the ones we followed) delivered.\xa0", 'For desert we had their signature\xa0Churro cup (Rs. 525). Note that there is nothing resembling a traditional churro here, only a cup made of the same stuff as a churro is.\xa0Said cup is stuffed with ice cream, chocolate sauce and\xa0other sweet things that were nicely\xa0balanced out by the texture of the churro. We loved it.', "This is where Let's Taco shines the most. The interior is spacious and gives plenty of privacy in\xa0different rooms with subtly different atmospheres. Art is all over the place, and most of it is quite nice.\xa0", "While slightly on the pricier end, Let's Taco more than delivers on quality, ambiance and service.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The slightly high prices are worth it for the amazing tex-mex this place has to offer. \n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A brand new Mexican fusion spot on Dickman's Road.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                     ‡∂±‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂∏ ‡∂∏‡∑ô‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑í‡∂ö‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ª‡∑É‡∂ß ‡∂ß‡∂ö‡∑ù ‡∂ö‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂ï‡∂± ‡∂±‡∂∏‡∑ä ‡∂∫‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± \n                                                                                                                            ']
user_reviews: ['\n                                            Amazing dishes and very filling! The portions are big. My order was a take away order. The staff requested me to dine in next time. Very satisfied ü§ó\n                                    ', "\n                                            Great food, tad pricey but hey you're getting Mexican food  in Sri Lanka\n                                    ", '\n                                            Let me start off with the good! ', '\r\nI absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the place. Its such a cute hangout spot. Love the indoor seating, feels like a little mexico. and the outside is just beautifully done, although felt a bit stuffy when we wanted to sit there first. ', '\r\nBut when we later saw the inside, w switched tables. ', '\r\n', '\r\nThe guys working there are SO nice and friendly. Absolutely loved their swift service!! Something that lacks in Colombo. ', '\r\n', "\r\nAlso, before going to Let's Taco, I read up on the reviews here on YAMU and they werent that great but I saw the reviews from Facebook and they were so nice. No idea why some people on here just want to come and comment on only the bad things. :( I did hear that Let's Taco struggled in the first weeks because they were always full and service was slow and all that, but I mean, even though there is no crazy rush now, they are doing so well in every aspect‚Ä¶which brings me to the food.", '\r\n', '\r\nOrdered a Black Pepper Beef Taco and the Beer Battered Fish Taco, Both were SO SO SO good!! My husband doesnt like fish but when he took a bite from my Fish taco he loved it! The whole platter is so nicely plated, it really is instagram worthy! and I could taste the freshness of the food too which is generally a hard thing to get here.

The food was good but at the end of the day it a Taco and Paying over Rs.1,000 for a Taco is ridiculous. Its like paying Rs.1,000 for a really good egg sandwich. ', '\r\n', '\r\nThe bill came to 3,740 for 2 Tacos and 2 fruit juices for my wife and I.', '\r\n', '\r\nFood is good, service is ok.\n                                    ', "\n                                            I went with my Hispanic girlfriend since it was new and this cuisine is right up her alley. As we walked in we were given one of the 2 round tables at the entrance. I had called earlier in the day to reserve and as we sat, the reserved sign was removed from the table. Above us, industrial fans spun at full speed making for a lot of noise. This was also disappointing my girlfriend as she had done her hair and the fans were just blowing like crazy. We were given 1 menu. So while once of us glanced at it, the other was twiddling their thumbs! Are you guys that short of menus that it is 1 menu per table? Not all table are ordering at the same time so you should have a decent amount of menus so whether a couple or a table of 10 sit down - everyone should have menus! We ordered drinks - their in-house special, green Lemonade and Orange - 1 bottle each. When the drinks arrived, they were so salty! I blame Kinita since she said they were so sweet in her review, the owners probably decided to throw a bunch of salt into the drinks :P Who drinks salty drinks with Mexican food? Mexican food has enough salt! Also add to the fact that the drinks weren't even chilled/cold. We couldn't ask for ice because they use these miniature milk bottles  so that there was no way ice could fit through the opening! If they are going to use cute bottles like this, then at least keep all the ingredients used for the drinks in a chilled place or better yet, invest in crushed ice and throw that in the bottle!", '\r\n', "\r\nWe ordered a plate of beef nachos and the spicy chicken taco plate to share. The nachos took 40 minutes to arrive table side. My girlfriend questioned why such a simple dish would take so long to arrive? A staff member did arrive to apologise for the delay and said it would not be more than 10 minutes. When she arrived - she just addressed my girlfriend - as if I didn't exist! Since she didn't know who was eating what - the correct thing to do would have been to apologise to both of us - not one of us. The nachos didn't even arrive within the 10 minutes she stated - they actually took 17 minutes on top of the 20 minutes we had already been waiting! It would have been nice to provide some complimentary chips table side with some salsa dip. At least if people have something to wet their appetite then they could probably endure waiting for their meal a little longer! When the food came, the taste was fine although initially when this place was mentioned, people kept bringing up Taco Bell and I thought that was rather rude to mention a fast food restaurant in the same vein as this restaurant. However after the nachos arrived - similarities to Taco Bell ensured. The beef used is ground beef and not steak beef as should be with nachos served at a none fast food restaurant level. There was a generous amount of beef, but ground beef is quintessentially what Taco Bell and other fast food Mexican joints would serve. So it's sad to see ground beef being used instead of steak beef diced up. The nachos also lacked re-fried beans and jalapenos. The spicy chicken tacos were tasty and the salsa while it had the right flavour was way too watery. Salsa should be able to be scooped using chips, but every time we attempted to scoop, it just ran off the chip. The guacamole was also tasty. The mains were worth the money for quantity. We had to request for sliced lime pieces to squeeze over the food. How does a Mexican food joint not provide cut up limes with ALL dishes? Salt should also be provided table side - in keeping with the Mexican ethos. ", '\r\n', '\r\nEven though the soft opening week had ended, it still felt as if they probably needed several more weeks to get things going more smoothly. It was hard to tell who worked there because everyone who worked there wore their own clothes! We wanted to stop people every now and then to ask stuff but weren\'t sure if they worked there or not. This place needs uniforms badly. All the staff (including owners) should wear a single colour t-shirt with the logo clearly on the front and back so we know who they are. The table next to us cleared and then a couple arrived, 10 minutes after they ordered their food, their nachos arrived, so service is very inconsistent. I went to use the bathroom only to find that there is a second larger section with air conditioning! This enraged my girlfriend because this whole time we were suffering with multiple industrial fans noisily above our heads when they had an air conditioned section all along. What\'s further upsetting was I called in advance to book a table, so at that point we should have been given the best table available (a table in the air conditioned area) or at least when we arrived - we should have been offered either the fan seating area or the air conditioned area - a choice that was never offered. The seating area right by the entrance is also very awkward. Just 2 small tables and then a lower waiting room style sofa + tables with people facing you. The front glass doors are also not tinted so people from outside can clearly see inside - offering no privacy. The pizza kitchen is right there with a clear door fridge and its contents facing the customers! We don\'t want to see what\'s inside the fridge when its just a mash of drinks and produce. The whole open kitchen area should be cordoned off better because it is barely used and really doesn\'t add to the ambiance - it isn\'t "cool". I also question why a place trying to make it as a Mexican restaurant feels the need to add pizza to the menu? That\'s like going to a Thai restaurant and seeing "burger and fries" on the menu. Stick to what you\'re about. ', '\r\n', "\r\nMy girlfriend spotted the catering menu and noticed that the images of tacos on that menu were blatantly taken from Taco Bell's menu! Here's a thing - if you don't want to be associated with Taco Bell - don't blatantly steal their images for your catering menu! Maybe hire a better printing company that doesn't lazily use Google images to make your menus! So overall with the excessive waiting times for the food and poor quality drinks, not to mention that the entrance seating area is probably the worst area to be in - while we were keen to try the churro cup for desert, my girlfriend didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for that. We decided to go elsewhere to satisfy our desert needs. We asked for the bill, but even that took more than 15 minutes to arrive after being requested several times! Too few people juggling too many things it seems. In the end the owner was nice enough to apologise and did make amends which i'm grateful for and I actually felt a little sorry given that it was a new business, but what was supposed to be a fun evening out, was honestly ruined. Overall the food was fair value for money but I still feel that Let's Taco still has a way to go. Food needs to be expedited better. Staff crisis handling needs to improve. Better quality drinks. Get rid of the fans and put A/C throughout the restaurant. Let's Taco is on the right track but someone needs to be steering this engine. I hope they can identify their problems and fix their issues, because I really want Let's Taco to work as Sri Lanka needs a good Mexican restaurant that isn't Taco Bell. \n                                    ", '\n                                            Food was amazing!

user_comments: ["\n\n                                    I just wish some one would open up a small taco stand or food truck instead. Tacos are meant to be cheap, filling , tasty and food meant for the masses. I will give this place a go because I love Mexican food and we are currently short of options in Colombo. However, the prices seem way too high. Also Taco Bell is fake-ass and shitty impersonation of Mexican food. It will be another multi-national franchise selling overpriced mediocre garbage. Let's support local businesses instead.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I really don't understand the pricing structure of these new restaurants. Everything seems to be over priced than they should be. It doesn't cost that much to make two tacos. Tacos are supposed to be cheap and big on flavor. ", '\r\n', '\r\nI\'m also very sad to see more and more places are opening up with no "Pork" options. Carnitas Tacos or Pulled Pork Tacos are supposed to be the highlight of a Taco restaurant.

', '\r\n', "\r\nDo NOT be fooled by the imagery that is shown on this Yamu review of a couple of tacos as we were - this is totally luck of the draw as we found the taco shells in some cases are not open at all and the fillings are measly as a result. A snack size was what came to us and for that price it just didn't add up. We saw others going out heaped full as the shells were more open so you can lose big time if your shells are not fully open‚Ä¶The restaurant needs to decide as a quality measure not to serve those taco shells as the result is a review like this and we cannot be the only customers experiencing a partial taco situ.,‚Ä¶They serve broken shells as chips anyhow - no waste.", '\r\n', '\r\nIf you are looking at two mains, two drinks, two deserts you are hitting almost 30USD or around 5,000LKR! It is unlikely there is a taco restaurant anywhere in the world hitting that price point without alcohol on the bill for two. ', '\r\n', "\r\nAs the dinning scene in CMB is diversifying rapidly, for people who don't know what mass market Mexican food is really like this may work although being underwhelmed at the price point is a high risk. The after feeling may be that you need a kothu for desert‚Ä¶.", '\r\n', "\r\nAs a credit however service people are nice although overwhelmed themselves running around like headless chickens - a bit more organization would be good and planning for peak traffic and large takeaways. The food is pre-made and assembled to order - there is hardly any 'cooking' involved. We saw people waiting for ages for a couple of tacos or their other mains - that's an epic fail for a taco joint. It would be highly advisable to serve some broken shells to people who are waiting for their orders as it buys some time at least - this is the breadbasket equivalent.", '\r\n', "\r\nAs this is an old garage + house circa 80s converted to restaurant you don't get the open plan flow thru however for a Taco joint they have done up the front in an interesting way. ", '\r\n', "\r\nThe food business is not easy, however its hard to get a taco business wrong - very hard - should generally be a low overhead place and super fast service of fresh clean food. Study Qdoba or Chipotle speed of service for burritos. These guys definitely need to figure out if they want to be a another CMB 'miss the mark' luxury restaurant that will lose its clients in 6 months or a solid quick place to go and enjoy an ultra fresh unique meal.
