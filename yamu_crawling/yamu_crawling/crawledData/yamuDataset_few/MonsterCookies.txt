However, these cookies simply don't look exciting at all to warrant the 4-stars! Brick Lane cookies are quite good, and served piping hot. And some others do lovely cookies, especially for christmas. They may taste lovely, but appearance counts too. I do sometimes wonder how you calculate your ratings… it seems rather arbitrary to me.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I think personally that these cookies tastes better than some world famous cookies. And they are so artistic in appearance:)\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Nice to see Monster cookies on this page! I\'ve had them, the cookies I mean and they\'re great. Value for Money. One certain cookie which I tried was the "gym junki" which was an oat cookie with fruit pieces in it. Loved it. However don\'t judge the cookies by the pictures. Order some, gobble them up and enjoy!  Plus I was offered a "customize your cookie" deal. You could do all sorts of things to make it look exciting \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The sugar cookies I tried were simply delicious!! I got them customized with wordings on it and the birthday girl simply loved it!! Great work Monster Cookies!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Oreo brownies are the most delecious brownies i ever had. I would not even hestitate to give 5 ratings for Monster Cookies because they deserve it.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    As a little treat for myself, i ordered a range of cookies from monster cookies, and they all tasted good, real homely feel…appearence was also in hand with the homely feel…the peanut butter choc and the mint choc was particularly good…will order again…\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I've tried both their cookies and brownies, and let me tell you they were absolutely delicious. Their brownies are hands down the best around; the ultimate chocolate indulgence! 5 stars. \n                                            "]
