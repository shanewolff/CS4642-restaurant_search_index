name: Cookie Bar
excerpt: A home-baker who makes some great cookies and cookie cups.
yamu_review: ["Cookie Bar is a home based\xa0business mainly focused on, as the name implies,\xa0cookies. They do soft gooey cookies as well as more creative items with good prices and reliable delivery. So if you're a Cookie Monster, this is a good bet.", 'They have assorted packs as well as individual cookies. So we tried both. The Assorted Pack (Rs. 750) comes with 2 Nutella Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookies, 2\xa0Crinkles, 2 Brookie Cups and 2 Triple Chunky Chocolate Chip Cookies. For the individual cookies (Rs. 100 each), we tried the Oreo Cookie Cup.', 'The Brookies were our favorite. It was absolutely delicious. The cookie dough was a\xa0thicker in texture as opposed to the gooey, chocolatey brownie base. There was a decent amount sweetness but not overwhelmingly so.\xa0', "The Nutella Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookie was alright. If you're a Nutella\xa0fan this would definitely satisfy those cravings. However, the dough tasted a little raw, and too sweet actually. It would have tasted better if had they used\xa0less sugar in the dough, as it was already sweet with the chocolate chips and the Nutella.\xa0", "The Crinkle was essentially a brownie with a generous dusting of powdered sugar. It might be too sweet if you're not the biggest sweet tooth but basically, it was everything you would expect in a crinkle. The gooey chocolatey brownie was baked perfectly and held together.\xa0", 'The Triple Chunky Chocolate Chip was our another favorite of ours. As you would expect, it was extremely chocolatey.\xa0There was a hint of dark chocolate and the texture was crunchier than the Nutella one. Overall, it was\xa0cookietastic.\xa0', 'The Oreo Cookie Cup was literally an Oreo stuffed in a cookie cup. Oreos go with anything so it was no wonder that this turned out great. There was a good ratio of chocolate chips as well.\xa0', "Their\xa0pick up point is, No. 17A, Glen Aber Place, Colombo 04. If not, you can call them up or send a message on FB or Instagram 24 hours earlier and place your order. They deliver after 3 pm. The ordering process is smooth and they're very responsive. Our order was delivered on time to the correct location. Totally hassle-free.", 'Cookie Bar does a new take on the ordinary cookie and their prices are quite reasonable. If you ever get any sweet tooth cravings, check them out.']
