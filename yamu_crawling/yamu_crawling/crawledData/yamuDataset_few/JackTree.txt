excerpt: Jack Tree's food is pretty tasty, if you eat here you're probably going to eat till it hurts a little to walk. It is however, pricey. Is it authentic Thai? We didn't think so, you get food here that the Sri Lankan palate is quite used to.
yamu_review: ["Situated down Park Road, Jack Tree does\xa0Thai and Chinese cuisine. They're run by the same group that runs ", ", which in turn whips up some pretty decent North Indian food. Jack Tree's got a pretty great vibe going on with a shaded and dimly lit interior upstairs, with some decent music playing.\xa0Their food, while okay, isn't mind blowing. However, their fresh fruit juices are pretty dope.", 'We opted to open with their Sweet Corn Chicken Soup (Rs. 425). While it came to the table steaming hot and laden with chunks of chicken, the soup itself was a tad denser than usual, and a bit too corn-starchy. Other than the almost porridgy thickness, the soup was alright in terms of flavour, with\xa0generous amounts of both sweet corn and chicken\xa0swimming in solidified egg whites.', 'Next, we went for a large Chicken Pad Thai (Rs. 1395) along with a Sizzling Beef Platter (Rs. 925).', 'The Pad Thai was also generous in portion, but was rather underwhelming where taste was concerned.', "It was surprisingly sweet\xa0and my friend, who practically lived off on pad thai while he was in Thailand, said that it lacked the tang of lemongrass and the actual taste of pad thai which he got there. On the bright side though, it's an enourmous portion so you can easily share it among four people (or three, if all of you are ravenous).", 'The beef was unexpectedly disappointing because it was like a regular dry beef curry, albeit a very chewy one. We brought some back to office, and some of the others found it quite hard to eat because of how tough and gristly it was.', 'For drinks, we tried their grape juice (Rs. 450) which was beautifully executed. Many places get juices wrong, either pouring too much water or sugar into it and thereby losing the essence of what makes a good fruit juice, but this was spot on.', 'It was liquified grape, nice and chilled, wonderfully\xa0', '\xa0saccharine sweet. Pretty perfect for a hot day!', 'Their Peach Iced Tea (Rs. 350) on the other hand, had a chockful of undissolved sugary syrup at the bottom.', 'It came filled with slices of lime as well, which was pretty refreshing, but the essence of the peach flavoured tea was lost among the syrup and citrusy overtones.', 'For dessert, we were told a couple of their items were unavailable after we placed the order, so we eventually settled for banana fritters with ice cream (Rs. 425).', 'Despite its rather unappealing appearance, it\xa0was quite good, with the fritters being hot-hot and crunchy on the outside, soft and mushy on the inside. It contrasted pleasantly with the dollop of vanilla ice cream which accompanied it.', "Service is friendly and efficient, with the waitstaff always being around. Nothing much to say about them really, because there wasn't anything particularly noteworthy.", "We loved the ambience of the dining area upstairs, because of how muted and calm the whole set up was. The interior was two toned, with green and beige being the colour scheme, and Jack Tree carries it off unexpectedly well. The area didn't feel crowded either, so that's a\xa0win.", "Lovely ambience, nice staff, but meh\xa0food which in the end\xa0isn't actually worth the cash you fork out for it. We're ok with splurging when the food's great, but we expect a lot more when prices are hiked\xa0up — especially when a beef dish is nearly a thousand bucks and is below average.", '\xa0', '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Jack Tree's new prices don't quite match up to the quality of their food.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Jack Tree's food is pretty tasty, if you eat here you're probably going to eat till it hurts a little to walk.

The place was very nice and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Food took 15 minutes to come and that was quick compared to many other places. We ordered seafood fried rice, a dish of chicken with cashew nuts and a spicy cuttlefish dish. The food tasted good and the fried rice had enough seafood there which was amazing. Also, their portions are very large and the staff was kind enough to pack us the remaining food that was in our dishes so that we could take it home. All dishes were priced at around Rs. 700 - Rs. 1000 and considering their generous portions and the incredible taste I would say that's fair. But I must mention that we ordered a papaya juice and an orange juice which cost us more than Rs.1000. The fruits were freshly prepared and tasted fine.

The curries were so rich and creamy with just the right amount of heat that I found myself heaping ladlefuls of it onto the rice. Especially the massaman curry was top notch and would go back just to have more. Service was prompt and pleasant and interior was nice and cosy. All around a very solid effort and would highly recommend to others on the lookout for tasty thai without jaw dropping prices ala Royal Thai.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Its quite telling when you read the more recent reviews indicating a restaurants pending demise…there are more thai options in CMB like quick thai, tom yum, home cooks etc that trump the value and taste of what jack tree offers or use to offer in this case!', '\n', '\nHaving tried their food recently I can say that we were right to have stopped ordering from jack tree given the high price and a significant and noticeable drop in quality of food.
