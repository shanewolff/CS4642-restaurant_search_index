Because Food city of Keels or what ever shop managers have to show the highest profit as possible as they can. So throwing foods away is not a good decision for them to make. So as a solution they do BBQs and then no one can find out whether they are expired or not.

I've seen it done at keels outlets with their fish cutlets. @ around Rs.10 a cutlet these get sold targeting the evening alcohol buyer; they turn awful just after a few hours. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Ravindu! you are spot on - this is a classic tactic used by supermarkets to clear near expiry items…they do the same with salads and other cut-up stuff - this was identified as a new revenue line at groceries in many other countries - they operate in the borderline of health and safety on this as the food is technically and legally still salable…where you see one of these stands is where the wastage is high! buyer beware and shop at the groceries which out such impromptu bbq stands! Sadly Yamu folks are not that business/globally savvy to have spotted this…\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Living right in front of the Cargills Food City and having more than once tasted this so called "best bbq" in town…i have to disagree very much. A 7 minute walk to the nugegoda junc you will get way better bbq at the Big Bite Biriyani spot (actually two of them in close proximity) ', '\r\n', '\r\nThe Cargills BBQ is basically burnt on high heat, where the outside it done nice and colored, but the inside (on more than one occasion) has been raw at best. You can hardly eat it to the bone, and on two occasions I found it to literally be raw with blood at the joints!!!', '\r\n', '\r\nIf you havent had BBQ in your life, then i would think this is the Best BBQ in town.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    What Ravindu has mentioned is right. I got to know this from a person who works at a certain cargills outlet. We can't think they are selling expired, but surely they are putting close to expire meats at BBQ's. They are doing the same with Vegi or Fruit Salads. Hope Cargills team would do a better service than cheap business tricks.\n                                            "]
