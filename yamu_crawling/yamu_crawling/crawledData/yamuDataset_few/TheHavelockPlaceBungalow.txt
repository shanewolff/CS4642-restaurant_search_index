name: The Havelock Place Bungalow
excerpt: Havelock Place Bungalow has got a charming little restaurant with a Barefoot-esque alfresco and good food. The prices aren't too bad, and their home-made ice cream is great. 
yamu_review: ["HPB is a charming, secluded little boutique hotel in the heart of Havelock Town. It holds an equally charming little al fresco restaurant, ensconced in foliage, and removed from the bustle of the city. It's actually one of my favourite spots in town, and even made it on to our ", '.', "We're glad to see the recent subtle improvements in service and attention to detail. The restaurant's played host to a couple of lovely ", "brunches and events, which has also helped raise its visibility (we're happy they're getting popular, but not happy our secret date spot is exposed).\xa0", "Their food has improved marginally but noticeably- there's a bit more attention to plating now, and the chalkboard menu is\xa0more interesting, but the fixed menu is totally the same. I also love that they've switched up the usual resto bread basket, and chose to open with pita bread and a tiny dip of hummus. If you're having a drink, I'd strongly recommend their wine list as it's fairly reasonable (you can get a regular Cava for about Rs. 2600, for example).", "We've had a ", ' in the past, so we decided to jump straight into mains this time around. We ordered both from the chalkboard specials, which is generally the best decision.\xa0', 'The Pan Roast Chicken with Semolina Mash and Ratatouille (Rs. 1250) was a fairly hefty portion, which could have been plated slightly better. It was a well balanced meal, with a little bit more oil than I would have liked (from both the chicken skin and the vegetables). The spicing was a lot more layered than I initially thought, and the semolina mash had a lovely, almost Indian flavour to it with plenty of\xa0sautéed\xa0curry leaves strewn in. Barring the oil, it was cooked to perfection.', "We also tried the Fillet of Mullet with Passion Fruit & Ginger Sauce (Rs. 1300), the flavours of which\xa0were\xa0delicious. The spices\xa0at play offset each other well, although\xa0the passion fruit sauce could have done with a bit more spice for the Lankan palate. The bed of rice and beans were a little boring and dry, but healthy enough. I would have prefered my fish marginally less cooked\xa0as it detracted from the mullet's naturally soft flesh that falls away under a stern fork prod. Overall, this dish was almost perfect in taste but not texture.\xa0", "Their dessert is generally brilliant. We've tried loads of their inventive ice cream flavours, ", ', all of which have been absolutely delicious. This time, we deviated a bit and tried the Slow Baked Lemon Tart. It was perfection enough to please Sansa, and the layer of brûlée\xa0on top just added to the great texture variation going on. The citrus was strong and compelling too.\xa0', "The service is significantly more enthusiastic and quick than it used to be. Our orders were taken and brought out within just about 15 minutes, and there was always a waiter within waving distance. It's still cosy and quiet though, so there was no bustling or hovering.\xa0", "The ambience was always the main draw of HPB. It's really small, with just about 6 tables and seating areas, dim lighting at night, and a lovely al fresco feel. You can wander around the property if you like, which you'll notice is a lot better maintained now. The bathroom never ceases to fascinate me, as it's almost completely open to the pond and walkway, but still somehow covered. A bit unnerving, but kind of cool in terms of design.\xa0", "The Bungalow is still a haven in the city, a little leafy oasis of solitude and romance. The food's gotten better, as has the service, but we'd love to see a whole new menu rolled out in the near future. A little more attention to culinary detail for regular meals would be great, and\xa0we look forward to more experiences and events being hosted there.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    One of Colombo's most charming little spots for drinks or dining.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Havelock Place Bungalow has got a charming little restaurant with nice alfresco dining.

I've always had great experiences at the Bungalow with respect to both the food and the service. The portions and quality of the food is spot on and is worth every penny. I love the fact that its fusion menu keeps changing quite frequently so there's always something new to try out. It's chilled out, low-key atmosphere is right up my alley and i'll always keep going there for more. FYI-  the pulled lemon grass pork with salted cucumber and apple salad,  the lemon tart and the Coffee & Arrack Ice Cream are absolutely to die for!\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Had lunch here recently and while the food was good, much was left to be desired where service was concerned.  One person in our group was late for a meeting and so we decided to skip dessert and called for our bill early. But our already somewhat indifferent waiter promptly told us the bill will get delayed as they had other bills to process before ours. We said ok and our friend left without waiting for the bill. So then since we were not in a rush anymore we asked for the dessert menu. Our waiter impatiently clucked his tongue and made a face as if it was a personal burden to him but did not move to bring us the menu. When asked again if we can order dessert he said "but then I will have to get you another bill". This went on a while, us trying to order and him telling us why we shouldn\'t.  In the end we left to have dessert elsewhere.  In case the owners are reading, it was a youngish waiter who was prematurely going gray.
