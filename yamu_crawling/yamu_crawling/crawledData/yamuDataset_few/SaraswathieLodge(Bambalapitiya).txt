It\'s filled with some kind of a potato paste and it\'s awesome. With a lot of dhal or what ever curry they have I can easily have 2 "Masala Those". Believe me. It\'s not a size of normal Those. It\'s HUGE :D\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Sarasvathie Lodge has a great history among the thosai lovers in Colombo.
