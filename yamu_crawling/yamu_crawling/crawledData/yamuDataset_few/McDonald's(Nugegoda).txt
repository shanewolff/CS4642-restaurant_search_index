name: McDonald's (Nugegoda)
excerpt: Indi and Shru have been making an effort to convince me of the merits of Mc Rice. I’ve responded with stubborn scepticism.  I don’t eat McDonalds (it’s not food snobbery, or maybe it is) but I’ll eat anything from the grimmest vaddai on the train to Trinco, to the offaly offerings served behind the butchers at Malay street.

I calmly went to the manager and told him that a young man walked in on me when I was using the facilities. He said, 'Oh yeah, it's no problem, he works here!'. I explained to him that there are procedures to cleaning a restroom for members of the opposite sex, and that he should have waited until there were no ladies inside and then propped the door open to signal that cleaning was happening. This would avoid problems. I also told him that if a man (or a woman) does not have this much common sense and they walk in on the other gender in the toilet they deserve a punch in the face. Otherwise, just take the signs down and have a communal toilet. He then backtracked and said the young man was still in training- IN OTHER WORDS, HE BLAMED THE EMPLOYEE when not one minute before he had said it was fine. BAD.
