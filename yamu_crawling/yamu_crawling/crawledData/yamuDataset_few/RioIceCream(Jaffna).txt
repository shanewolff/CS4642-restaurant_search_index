name: Rio Ice Cream (Jaffna)
excerpt: The original Rio Ice Cream parlour is old and sweet- it's persisted through decades of war and strife as an integral part of the local community. It's worth a diabetic shock or two to experience that.

user_comments: ["\n\n                                    It was a rip off on 16 th October 2016 around 6 pm. We ordered four coffees. They didn't have any other short eats at all. Coffee was not at all good. We asked them to add more coffee powder and bring back. While paying , they didn't give any bills. The cashier was told to charge for four coffees. The shop was completely empty. He asked 430 rupees for four coffees. I paid five hundred rupees and got 70 rupees balance.  I am sure that coffee must be around 30 rupees each as per Malayan cafe in Jaffna and other coffee shops. They tried to cheat the tourists going there which gives a bad reputation about Jaffna. They are trying to cheat Nallur devotees and tourists in that area. It has to be stopped.\n                                            "]
