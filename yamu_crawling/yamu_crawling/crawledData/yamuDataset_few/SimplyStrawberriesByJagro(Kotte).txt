name: Simply Strawberries By Jagro (Kotte)
excerpt: Jagro's branch in Kotte more cozy and perfect for hangouts. 
yamu_review: ["The only place in Colombo that's dedicated to just strawberries, Jagro always attracts\xa0the locals. Now people in the Battaramulla/Kotte area have access\xa0through their new branch here.", "Their menu hasn't changed at all since our last visit so we went with the most popular dishes.", 'First off we tried the Waffle With Berries And Cream (Rs. 550). It delivered. The giant waffle was excellent with a great\xa0crunchy texture at the edges.\xa0As usual, it was topped with a\xa0ridiculous amount of\xa0strawberries, fresh cream and your pick of either strawberry or chocolate sauce. I love how messy it always gets with the cream and sauce. A deliciously sweet dessert.', "Next up is one of my personal favorites, the Chocolate Sandwich (Rs. 650). The chocolate cake was a little cold which obviously meant it had been sitting in the fridge for a while, however, it wasn't crumbly. In fact, it was surprisingly gooey in the middle and very chocolatey. The abundance of cream, chocolate sauce, and the strawberries added with\xa0that big chunky cake slice made up for a very filling dessert. We suggest you share this with your\xa0partner or friend.", 'As per tradition, we had to get a cheesecake too. The Raspberry Cheesecake (Rs. 650) was really delicious, no surprise there. The sweetness of the no-bake filling and the sourness of the raspberry coulis added up to a well-balanced, succulent cheesecake. The buttery and slightly crumbly biscuit base added that extra oomph.\xa0', "They don't have an extensive drinks menu, only the strawberry juice,\xa0Strawberry smoothies and milkshakes.", "The Strawberry Milkshake (Rs. 350) was kind of a letdown. There was way too much milk and not enough strawberries. Since they never skimp on the\xa0strawberries, I was expecting a lot more flavor and for that price, I don't think it's worth it.", "The\xa0service is great. They're very friendly and\xa0attentive to what you order that you hardly have to repeat yourself. Except for the waffles and the milkshake, everything else is pre-made so our food arrived within 10\xa0minutes which was great.", "Compared to their other outlets, this is by far the most spacious which means it rarely gets congested. It's a great place to unwind and satisfy those sweet tooth cravings. They also have an upstairs seating area as well.\xa0", "Jagro continues to be one of the go-to spots for some delicious, filling desserts. They have managed to keep up their standards and continues to serve the freshest strawberries in town. We don't have to tell you twice to go check them out.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Same great strawberries, much bigger outlet.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Jagro's Simply Strawberries is a dedicated dessert spot in Ethul Kotte\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    රාස්ප්බෙරි චීස් කේක් එක නම් ආයේ කතා දෙකක් නැහැ සුපිරි. මේකේ උඩින් ලෝබ නැතුව රාස්ප්බෙරි ටොපින් එකක් වත්කරලා තිබුණා. නියම නැවුම් රාස්ප්බෙරිවලින් එන ලා ඇඹුල් රසට, චීස් කේක් එකේ පැණි රස එක්කාසු වෙද්දී පට්ට ම ගති. තැනින් තැනින් රාස්ප්බෙරි කෑලිත් හැපෙද්දී මේ රස තව දෙගුණ තෙගුණ වෙනවා.\n                                                                                                                            ']
