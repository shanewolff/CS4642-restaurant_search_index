excerpt: So another day in our quest for a restaurant (not a hole in the wall/buth kadai) that serves a good rice and curry meal. We had a hot tip on The Angler a small restaurant down Hotel Road just up the road from the Mt Lavinia Hotel. We heard they served up a good homestyle curry with an emphasis on seafood, so expecting delicious piles of squid and prawn curry we rushed down to everyone’s favorite beachside suburb.

Nothing was really outstanding, the fish,\xa0ash plantain, and dhal were just so-so, the portions just about fed\xa0three people and that became an issue when we were presented with the\xa0bill - \xa0Rs. 3000. \xa0Which seems a lot for a modest curry meal for three\xa0especially if you consider a downright delicious buth kadai meal can\xa0be Rs 150. Mind you, this includes Rs. 190 for each of three lime sodas, but still.', "This isn’t to say our experience was bad, the rice and curry was fine\xa0and the hosts lovely but for the price you expect a little more than\nan average set of curries.\xa0So The Angler fails to fill this city’s dire need for a restaurant\xa0(shout out to Green Cabin for the best attempt), that serves the full\xa0spread of delicious vegetables, seafood, meat and sambals that, when\xa0you're lucky, \xa0you find at people’s homes.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    So another day in our quest for a restaurant (not a hole in the wall/buth kadai) that serves a good rice and curry meal.
