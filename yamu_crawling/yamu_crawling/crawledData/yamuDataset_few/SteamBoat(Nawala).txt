Just a few minutes back I called and placed a order which consisted of several items from their thai menu. few minutes after placing the order, I called back to change the tofu dish to a prawn dish. Although they admitted the kitchen has not started on the order yet, they simply refused to take any ammendments to the order saying the "order is closed". it was clear that the guy who answered the phone couldnt be bothered checking with the kitchen if they could accomodate the request. probably the last time I will order from this establishment.\n                                    ', '\n                                            There is so cool service in steam boat bar (black out) employees who in there really frindly and gentle.
