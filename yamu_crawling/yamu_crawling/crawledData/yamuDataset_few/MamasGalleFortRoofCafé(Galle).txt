address: 76 Leyn Baan Street, Galle 
directions: This Mama's is near the mosque and lighthouse. Entering Fort, you'll get directed down Church Street. Follow that to the end and we recommend parking by the Ramparts. Then walk up the next h to your left (towards the lighthouse). That's Leyn Baan. Mama's is just 20 meters up, before the Fish Spa.
