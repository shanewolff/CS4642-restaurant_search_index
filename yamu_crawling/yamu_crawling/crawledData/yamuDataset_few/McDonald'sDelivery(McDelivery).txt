name: McDonald's Delivery (McDelivery)
excerpt: We order from McDonald's far more than we probably should, but that's because their delivery is efficient, reliable and quite fast!


yamu_review: ["We were wondering just how long it would take McDonald's to get on the delivery band wagon, and today they finally did. The criteria for delivery is simple - a minimum order amount of Rs. 600 and being in Colombo in the suburbs (or near a McDonald's outlet). This could be subject to change in the future depending on how this picks up. We have a nagging feeling McDelivery will be hugely popular.", '\xa0', 'We got a double cheeseburger meal (Rs. 620) and a chicken McSpicy (Rs. 400). Both arrived intact with no spillage. They also send two sachets of chilli and garlic sauce. The fries that came with the meal were slightly soggy but we were somewhat expecting that.', '\xa0', "In our case the delivery was fast, as in less than 20 minutes, but we're pretty close to their Colpetty outlet. If we were to make a suggestion, we'd say the best bet would be to order just the burgers since the fries can get soggy and the drinks can lose their fizz over long deliveries.", "The phone call for the order did take a fair bit of time, but that's mostly because they wanted information to enter in their customer database. So I'd expect the order time to be far less when calling them next time around. They deliver from ", " which is also pretty awesome. As far as we know they deliver to Colombo and suburbs, but it's very likely they'll deliver to other areas with McDonald's outlets.", '\xa0', "They charge a flat Rs.100 for delivery which is also reasonable. Who knows, maybe that'll also be removed after sometime to compete with the others.", 'If you ever find yourself craving McDonalds, you can now get it delivered. Besides the somewhat long phone call, they seem pretty efficient.']

The food was still warm & delish! I'm super glad that McD's finally has delivery!

In the last week itself over 5 times. Generally I get the order from Colpetty store who delivery in 20 mins and quote 30 mins. This is good. Past 4 times they had changed the store to Race Course and it takess over an hour to for the order to come.  When i complian they say it will be there in 10 mintues today it took me 1hr 30 mins to get my lunch order And they kepy saying iin 10 mins in 10 mins even the store manager called and sed 10 mins after abt 1 hour .  I told him its already been a huge delay so if you dont come in next 10 mins I will be leaving to work and to cancel the order. Guess what… It did not come in 10 mins. After 30 mins the guy calls when I was at office after having picked up lunch on the way from another place.

Most of the time when select payment method as credit card the rider always forgets to bring the machine, And the riders don't understand English and some Sinhala even, no knowledge about roads and clueless in directions.  Always somethings wrong. On top of that they charge 150 for this crappy service. ", '\n', "\nToday I placed the order with credit card as my payment option and as usual they forgot to send the machine and I send him off to fetch it.  after about 1 and a half hours time he comes back but guess what the machine is on low battery so cant use ( he actually asked if I have a suntel CDMA phone charger so that he can charge it in my house, which I didn't).

Shame on you! They ignore children and serve adults. This child was waiting in line for an ice cream and when she got to the front of the line, the server kept serving others behind her and completely ignored this child. I waited to see what would happen and and this guy kept ignoring this child… After him ignoring her and serving four other orders who were standing behind her (these sorry excuses for humans in Sri Lanka for taking advantage of this little child) I couldn't bear it anymore and I had to yell at that server… the worst part was that the server was a shift manager… I think a fifty rupee order was beneath him… I saw another server lying to another child saying that there was no ice cream and the child goes disapointed… what happens next? The foreigner standing behind orders four cones and takes it away… I guess they dont want to serve 50 rupee orders again!. I am a very big fan of McDonalds and eat alot as well as bring the entire family. As of today, I am stopping Mcdonalds and am switching to Burgher King… I am also going to spread the word on Social Media and other review sites and media as much as I can… Absolutely pathetic and sorry excuse for humans as staff.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    This should be bring to the Consumer Affairs Authority.
