excerpt: Plant your feet in the sand and watch the waves roll in as the traffic of Mt Lavinia Beach frolic by. Apart from this initial attraction the rest of our experience was somewhat forgettable.

If they could only add on a few new dishes, would definitely love to visit again. As it is, the menu has become rather boring now. \n                                    "]
user_comments: ["\n\n                                    That's like going to the Bavarian and complaining they don't serve a rice and curry! To not re visit the restaurant based on the food which you never tasted is not really a fair review (unless of course your only gripe was the rat)\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Lavinia Breeze is not a hotel, it's just the Restaurant, but Mount Breeze has a Hotel and a Restaurant. Btw our experiences with Lavinia Breeze were outstanding. I guess you need to add the rat part since its missing.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Large what?  Rat?  Same happened to us and the waiter dismissed saying it was quite normal.

How can you judge a place without even eating the food? and large WHAT? ', "\r\nI have been to Lavinia Breeze a couple of times and the food has always been good. You can't review a restaurant without sampling its food!

They didnt have a buffet or anything and rice was not there. Main meal was only two prawns, a cutlet and carrots/cabbages. had a soup also, and the funny part was that they gave us only one dessert to share and they said it's Love. Oh Great ! i will never go to this place again and will never recommend to anyone.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Terrible review about a terrible place. Having tried the food about a year ago, it was as atrocious as the bill. The restaurant's appearance had also taken a beating. It looked forlorn and neglected. To top it all, there was a dead gecko fossilized on the cashier's glass window. Never been there since. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    This seemed more like a bar than a restaurant and not a place for a family.

Hope they will continue to offer the same service in future. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I got to know this place from couple of my friends who had been there earlier and they highly recommended the standard of the food. When I first went there I was pleased with the car park facility and the service I received. But I had some doubts about the hall as it didn't look very glamour during the day time. Also I had some second thoughts after going through some of the reviews published in the web.

Also they were good enough to change the menu as per my requirement. ', '\r\nOn the day of the occasion, they were very helpful for me to arrange the hall. They even went out of the way to find some decorations at the last moment for me. The hall looked marvellous in the night. The Manager was there right through out the function to make sure every thing is going smoothly. The food was excellent and all of the attendees commented on that. The batter fried prawns which served then and there added some action to the buffet. Through out the function the staff was very cooperative.    ', '\r\nIt was a very important function for me and I would like to thank Mr. Chang, Mr. Kapila, the Chef who personally spoke to me regarding the menu and the staff for making the function a memorable one to me and my family.
