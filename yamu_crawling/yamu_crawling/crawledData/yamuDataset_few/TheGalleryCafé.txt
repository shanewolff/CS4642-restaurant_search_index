yamu_review: ["It's been 3 years since our last visit. Aside from a few minor changes, it's more or less the same. The food is consistently good, and it will still leave a dent in your wallet. It's located on Alfred House Road, down Alfred House Gardens.", 'Their menu has not changed since our last visit. They have an extensive menu consisting of Western, French, Italian, Asian cuisines as well as some locally inspired dishes.\xa0', 'We started off with a Chicken Meditteranean Salad (Rs. 1245) which I have to say, took me by surprise. There seemed to be a lot more add-ons to the traditional\xa0Meditteranean Salad and it paid off. The chickpeas and the cashews brought so much crunch and flavor to the dish that it did not feel like a starter at all, more like a main. The veggies were fresh and the chicken bits were thinly sliced, therefore, easy to bite into. It was tossed with a honey garlic sauce which added the perfect amount of sweetness to it. It was a great a choice.', "As our mains, we got a Chicken Nasi Goreng (Rs. 1850) which did not feel like it was worth all that money. The portion itself was decidedly small with a very little chicken and seafood pieces mixed in. Not to say that it wasn't delicious\xa0because it was, but I have certainly had better for much less. Also, I have to mention, they have added a bit too many additives because as soon as I ate it, I felt bloated and very drowsy.\xa0", 'Finally, we tried the Coq Au Vin (Rs. 1345) cause I wanted to try something I have never tried before and may I just say, this was a solid choice. A Coq Au Vin basically is a braised chicken with wine, mushrooms, garlic, and lardons. This was not the most authentic version as they have used onions instead of garlic and of course, no lardons. It also came with a side of mashed potato, a puff pastry, and a side salad.\xa0', 'The chicken braised was delicious with a strong taste of wine and a tinge of spiciness. There was a potful of chicken inside, enough for two people and they were cooked perfectly. The mashed potato was creamy, smooth and melts in your mouth. It was amazing. The puff pastry, oh wow! It had a golden crisp on the outside with a buttery smooth layer on the inside. It was warm and paired well with the chicken.\xa0', "Our dessert was a Mocha Hazelnut\xa0Cheesecake (Rs. 795) which again, was really good. The base was a thick coffee layer which dialed the sweetness of the mocha hazelnut filling, although it wasn't that sweet, to begin with. It came with a side of melted ice cream which was a nice addition.", "We were also served complimentary pieces of bread\xa0which were phenomenal. On our previous visit, there had been only one bread served and it had been served cold. It's really nice to see that they have improved on it, as we were served not one but 3 pieces of bread\xa0and they were all served warm and smelled fresh.", 'They have a separate\xa0beverages menu which has cocktails, mocktails, fresh juices, coffee, tea etc.', 'I ordered a Mojito but they served me a Virgin Mojito (Rs. 545). Anyhow, it was still a good drink. It was refreshing, cool and acidic which is everything you would expect in a mojito.', 'The staff is very professional and courteous, but the food takes ages to arrive. We had to wait for good 30 minutes waiting for the mains. We had to fill\xa0up on bread cause we were really hungry.', "The place is really beautiful and gives off a colonial vibe with its architecture and furnishing. The outdoor area, in particular, is pretty neat. There's enough space to hold the customer flow they get during the lunch rush and if the weather allows, I suggest sitting outside. It's very nice.\xa0", "It's a great spot to celebrate a special occasion cause they do have candlelit dinners, or even to just have a late lunch with your family. Keep in mind, you would have to wait a long time for the food which is the only major issue we encountered. Other than that, while the prices are exorbitant, the food is quite good.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    While the prices are exorbitant, the food is quite good.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Gallery Cafe is one of those perpetually hip spots in Colombo.

Such a disappointment  \n                                    ', '\n                                            The Gallery Cafe is one of those places in Sri Lanka which was a unique place for me to experience Fine dining food. BUT yesterday I had to go through an unpleasant situation with them. I called in advance and spoke to their reservations person “Neethi” and told him that I would be celebrating my anniversary in their restaurant so he suggested that the dessert would be decorated and would have a wording depicting “Happy Anniversary” BUT he forgot to convey the message and as we got to the dessert there was nothing special just their usual dessert which we ordered “Chocolate Nemesis” in which the peach coulis was off which leads me to believe that the sauce bottles are not changed daily. For the starters we ordered “Grilled Prawns with Rocket Aioli and Batter Fried Whitebait”. They advertise whitebait on the menu which comes at a price of Rs. 995/=, but they served the local fish which was Handallo which was deceiving but the charges were still the same. Even the server admitted that it was Handallo and not Whitebait. For the Entree we ordered “Chicken with Bacon and Butterfly Prawns with Coconut Risotto”. In both the starter and the Entree, the Prawns were way over cooked, and the Risotto was dry. Clearly it was not cooked to order instead microwaved. I called them and spoke to their manager Ashan and he told me that this is the first time something like this was happening. When I mentioned that their reviews say otherwise, he was saying that the reviews are just reviews. Clearly, he does not care about the customers. I also acknowledged that they have a special place towards foreigners but not the locals.  After explaining all of this to Ashan he took my number telling that their owner will contact me which never happened. I feel sorry as this place has so much potential to be the best restaurant in Sri Lanka instead I was totally disappointed, and our special date was ruined.               \n                                    ', "\n                                            We are eating at gallery cafe as I write this.

My friend's burger came with exactly 4 french fries. Colombo offers better more reasonable food in so many places. So sad to see a great and lovely restaurant tarnished by a stunning lack of attention. Profoundly disappointed.\n                                    "]
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    I advice not to patronize this joint. I have been there few times and every time I have been disappointed more and more until one day I ordered one their famous (or in my opinion infamous) "black pork curry" dish.  This joint\'s lights are very dim and I was eating the darn thing not actually seeing what I was eating. I put a piece of pork in my mouth ( a big one as I could not cut it) and started chewing. I could not chew it and found to my horror that it was s huge piece of fat. I did not go to this joint after that. The prices are exorbitant and the portions are very small.  The cocktails are also not tasty and service just average. If you ask me it\'s daylight robbery. Go to this joint if you have money to burn. Otherwise don\'t even think about it.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    sl black pork curry is with fat :-)', '\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    You couldn't chew pork fat?

(Lemon Meringue Pie and Creme brulee is superb). But sometimes like the first person here mentioned, the service has been not so good, and once some exorbitant bottled water was served without being requested but bill couldn't be disputed as there were guests from abroad at the table (well I think a foreign guest had requested it for herself and waiters had served the whole table the same!) .

It's curious that the reviewer thinks consistency is the secret of its success. Foodie TV has taught me that restaurant kitchens have something called a 'pass', where the overseer can check everything that goes out and halt it if need be. I refuse to believe that the GC is even aware of this practice. OK, if you fancy black pork curry and coconut ice cream, you won't be disappointed.", '\r\n', "\r\nAnother point: the reviewer wants the GC to try for excellence. This is what the Tintagel (same stable) does - tries, I mean. I'm guessing the owner prefers to differentiate the Tintagel - to ensure that it's superior to the GC. Otherwise what would be the point? It's a similar cuisine.
