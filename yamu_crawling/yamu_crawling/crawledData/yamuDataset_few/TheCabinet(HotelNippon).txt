name: The Cabinet (Hotel Nippon)
excerpt: The bar and lounge of historic Hotel Nippon
yamu_review: ["Started as a mansion during the colonial era, Nippon is one of the oldest landmarks of Colombo’s history. Today it's a hotel with a restaurant (", '), cafe (', ") and a pub (The Cabinet).\xa0They're\xa0well-known\xa0for their legendary mutton rolls, delicious chicken lamprais and reasonably priced cocktails and bites, among other things.\xa0", "The Cabinet\xa0is on tap from 10 am in the morning. The\xa0alcohol is considerably cheap, and they've got a bunch\xa0of fruit juices and cocktails for you to choose from.\xa0", 'The Nippon Green Apple (Rs. 499.69) from their signature cocktail range was pretty simple - Vodka and apple juice with a tinge of spiciness\xa0that comes from the chili rimmed glass. In terms of presentation, it certainly has\xa0room for improvement,\xa0but the flavours worked well together.\xa0', 'We also tried a Margarita (Rs. 635.44), which was our favourite out of the two.\xa0Involving the usual margarita mix, generous amount of Tequila and garnished with a lime\xa0twist, it had all the elements of a good margarita in the right balance.', 'The Pepper Pork (Rs. 522.75) was excellent! It was piping hot, and had an incredible flavour. The meat was cooked to perfection with\xa0a firm rind, and one of two fat bits that melt\xa0in your mouth. Seasoned with black pepper,\xa0crunchy green chilies and onions, this is a very generous portion of pork.', "The Prawn Balls (Rs. 530.44) we tried at The Cabinet is probably one of the best ones out there. It's basically five big\xa0spheres of mashed prawn, golden\xa0batter fried\xa0and tasted amazing, especially with the chili sauce that came with it. They were light, puffy and not crazy-oily, and we\xa0devoured it within minutes.\xa0", 'The service\xa0was pretty decent. The staff was polite, attentive and helpful. Our\xa0food and drinks arrived within\xa015 minutes.\xa0', 'In terms of the ambiance, it has a strong retro-themed vibe\xa0going on, with wooden furniture and vintage posters hanging on the wall.', "All in all, we really enjoyed our experience at The Cabinet. They've got some good cocktails, delicious bites and their prices are comparatively lower than the other pubs and bars around. Our total bill came to Rs.2870 including service charges and taxes, which is pretty cool considering that it is, in fact, a bar attached to a popular hotel in Colombo.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Cabinet is the bar and lounge of historic Hotel Nippon.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    අවුරුදු එකසිය ගාණක් ගිහිල්ලත්  තාමත් වයසට නොගිය නිපොන් හෝටලේ බාර් එක. \n                                                                                                                            ']
