The service was attentive and attention to detail perfect. I loved the way my soup had a doiley under it, and we got ornate fish forks and knives for the fish course; very old world! The view was superb and it was excellent value for money. Definitely visit the Harbour Room! \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Good cocktails (Rush) and carbonara\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Food sucks here  Last week I went for lunch. Asparagus soup was horrible. It had no taste. Asparagus soup also has to be greenish, but this was white in color. I think they gave something else. Very few cocktails in the list was available.  Baked crab was full of vegetables which did not taste good at all.  Nothing "Grand" about this place.  I am beginning to think whether we got what it takes to run even a decent hotel. My experience with the Sri Lankan food scene is that 90% is rubbish. Only a handful of places are good.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    love to visit and graze @ the ships in harbour\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    G.o.h.harbour room manager treated us like thrash.
