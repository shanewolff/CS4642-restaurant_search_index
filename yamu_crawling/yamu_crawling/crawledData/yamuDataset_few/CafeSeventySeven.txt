name: Cafe Seventy Seven
excerpt: A small pastry shop for an evening snack and iced coffee.
yamu_review: ["Cafe Seventy-Seven opened up on Maitland Crescent a couple of weeks ago so we dropped in for a quick bite after work. They also have a branch in Kollupitiya but they're still figuring things out here so there's not a lot to find about it online.\xa0", "It's located right next to Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on Maitland Crescent with ample parking space.", "They have pastries on display as well as a small lunch menu which includes\xa0fried rice, lamprais and rice and curry. We didn't visit at lunchtime this time around, but we'll try their rice options in the future.", 'We got ourselves a Mini Veggie Pizza (Rs. 130), a Cheese Bun (Rs. 100) and a\xa0Prawn Roll (Rs. 90). All of them\xa0were popped in the microwave and served warm.\xa0', "We also tried an Eclair (we don't know the price cause they forgot to bill it). That was a huge disappointment. The pastry was hard as a rock. The chocolate filling was way too sweet that we didn't take more than two bites from it.\xa0", 'They only had Iced Coffee (Rs. 100) and Hot/Cold Milo (Rs. 50) at the moment so we got one of each.', "The Iced Coffee was our favourite. It wasn't too sweet so I tasted the bitter caffeine and it was delicious enough that I wish they had given us a bigger glass. It's worth the 100 bucks. \xa0", "The Hot Milo is a quick rejuvenation on a rainy day but it's so small that it won't take more than two gulps to finish.\xa0", "Service was far from perfect and I would have ignored it given the fact that they're just starting out, but\xa0forgetting to charge not one but two items cannot go unnoticed. We remembered the price for the prawn roll that's why it is mentioned above but we were not charged for it and by the time we realised it, it was too late.", 'The staff is friendly\xa0enough if you strike up a conversation with them, otherwise, they pretty much mind their own business.\xa0', 'As you can see, the place is really small and only accommodates about 10 people. I really liked the glass walls because it\xa0makes the place feel less congested.\xa0', "I would say it's the one and only place in the area where you can grab a quick bite to eat for these prices so in that case, they've hit the jackpot. I'm sure they would improve on their service in the days to come\xa0so drop in for some iced coffee and a mini pizza."]
user_reviews: ['\n                                            Its basically small snack bar with low quality street food. They sell a  few types of  common short eats and also serve  rice and curry during lunch. The buns are limp the pastries are hard and overall pathetic. In this Colombo 7 locale, this outlet is like a fish out of water.', '\n', '\nHowever there is a good cheaply priced Iced coffee. ', '\n', '\nThere are two parking slots in front. The service is lethargic and unfriendly \n                                    ', "\n                                            I visited the place on a Saturday, didn't find the pizza your review talks about. Had lunch though, through their Sri Lankan buffet. It was good \n                                    "]
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    They have a branch at Nawaloka hospital which serves some great hoppers in the evening. I wonder if they serve hoppers here as well. \n                                            ']
