name: Nuga Gama (Cinnamon Grand)
excerpt: Ensconced in a great banyan tree in the heart of Colombo’s entertainment district, Nuga Gama serves signature Sinhala cuisine, escapism and enchantment. To have dined there is to have glimpsed at an ancient Sri Lanka that has long-since begun to disappear into a blur of Western technicolour.

But it certainly is the best place for a foreign visitor to sample the delights of authentic Lankan cuisine.
