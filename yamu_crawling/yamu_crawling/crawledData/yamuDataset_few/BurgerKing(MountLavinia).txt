name: Burger King (Mount Lavinia)
excerpt: To quote the Notorious BIG, it looks like Softlogic is representing BK to the fullest. The Whopper tastes authentic, the service is competent and the location is well equipped and smart. The restaurant doesn't go beyond the usual Burger King flavor, but it's not supposed to. It's very new, but we'd say that this franchise hits the mark.

I dono if u guys r out of ur minds or are simply MC Donald\'s fanboy ! I have always had the double whooper beef with cheese as well as the whooper beef with cheese and I can attest to the fact that these burgers taste just like the ones I have tasted abroad having lived my whole life in a middle Eastern country. Not only do they taste the same but size wise as big as the ones served abroad. Try comparing the double whooper to the biggest burger of MC Donald\'s and see for ur selves. These can\'t get even close to the size of the double whooper of burger king. Compared to the standards of kfc Sri Lanka which by the way serves chicken tikka, buriyani and hot and crispy chicken which according to KFC Sri lanka is the colonel\'s original secret receipe and people here buy that idea ! Ever heard of "colonel\'s original receipe chicken" ?
