excerpt: The brand new Mövenpick Hotel Colombo's all-day dining restaurant.
yamu_review: ["Priced at Rs. 3,000 AYU at Mövenpick Colombo is one of the newer additions to Colombo's buffet repetoire. This was our second visit since Kinita's ", ". TL:DR she found it very promising but it was still a work in progress with some\xa0promising things still at the stage of promises (I'd say it was like the parliament, but that stopped giving even remotely promising vibes a long time ago).", "It's easy for buffets to get carried away and try to offer too many different options, without really doing anything particularly well. Luckily, AYU manages to strike a healthy balance between variety and quality.", 'The cheese, bread, cracker and\xa0jam\xa0station was exceptional, with a great variety of cheese and jam to choose from. The space had meats as well, but like we said above, no one was manning the cold cuts machine to give us any. And no one turned up even after we asked (repeating myself because actually peeved).', 'The salad station was dope. A quinua and dried tomato salad, combined with\xa0manioc chips and hummus had me drooling. We were happy to see a few Middle Eastern favourites like baba ganoush in the mix, though I did find it a bit too tangy for my liking.', "When it comes to buffets there's always going to be hts and misses, but the vast majority of them were hits so the misses can be safely ignored, or accounted for taste. The continental section had some great mini-beefstakes, grilled chiken and fish\xa0but their potatoes were a bit lackluster.", "The Sri Lankan section was excellent, there was a mutton curry in particuluar which was delicious. The devilled seafood didn't look too apetizing so I\xa0skipped that. But with red rice, dhal, curries and an army of 'rice-pullers' from papadams to more pickles than your pickle-obsessed aunty can identify\xa0provided this entire section with more local flavor than a lip servicing conference on reconciliation and\xa0diversity.\xa0", "There was a small japanese section, which didn't impress too much. It contained\xa0salmon and crab maki rolls, they were decent, but lacked that melt-in-your-mouthiness that good sushi will give you.Overall I\xa0would give this section a resounding shrug.", 'Desserts occupied their own table, in a separate room, so you know they take it seriously. Everything that was tried met with resounding approval, the sago pudding was my personal favourite.\xa0', '.', 'The drinks menu has a variety of cocktails and mocktails specially offered by the restaurant. The Ebony (with cognac, butterscotch ice cream, nutella and oreo Rs. 1190) looked like a heart attack in a mason jar, so we tried the Kiwi Granate (Rs. 990) which comes with bacardi, pomegranate and kiwi. This was a bit too sweet for my taste but both Kinita and Bhagya had enjoyed it during their visits to Vistas and Robata.', 'We went in for a late lunch (around 2p.m.) and found that the service was beginning to tire a little. Like for example, there was no one attending the cold cuts station, which was a bit disappointing. Besides that the staff was friendly and generally attentive, though a bit more attention to detail nearing the end of service is required.', "AYU really exudes an upmarket feel with plenty of natural light that bounces off the marble and ceramic surfaces beautifully. It doesn't look at all like a run of the mill hotel buffet, the food islands were artfully placed and dispersed throughout a wide space.", 'A nice place for a mid-range, satisfying meal, service can be a little lazy. The ambience and vibe is classy without being too stodgy.\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The AYU has got its act together with food that is mostly good, and an ambiance that is easy and relaxed. \n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The shiny new Mövenpick Hotel in Colombo's main restaurant.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    දැන් මෙතන තියෙන හොඳම දේ තමයි ජනේලෙන් එළියේ පේන දර්ශනේ. ඉතිරිවා ගෙවන මිලට වටින තත්ත්වෙකට ඉක්මනට පොලිෂ් වෙලා එයි කියල අපි බලාපොරොත්තු වෙනවා.\n                                                                                                                            ']

Buffet alone, without drinks, came to Rs.3345/- pp. To be fair, the food did taste good, especially the desserts, but places such as Taprobane (Cinnamon Grand) and Graze Kitchen (Hilton) in my opinion, offer far better choice and value for money. I wouldn\'t exactly call any buffet "fine dining", but for the price and venue, I wish they\'d to adhere to some sort of dress code. Semi-casual would be ok, but people walking in wearing t-shirts and flipflops kinda ruined the experience for me. Maybe you guys at Yamu could write an article advising diners on dress codes for various restaurants? One more thing….what\'s the deal with service charges in SL? We generally do tip regardless, but for a buffet?\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    In terms of service, service charge is generally included at 10% so you're not obliged to tip on top of that. However, if you've had particularly good service another 10% in cash is generally good practice!", "\r\nAs for the dress code, it seems to be pretty arbitrary in Colombo, and implemented only when the staff doesn't like somebody.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I have to say I don't get this whole service charge thing, for buffet meals especially. All the waiter has to do is bring you a drink. Then you serve yourself. So you're doing the serving, why are we being charged service charge? Personally I think it's a bit of a con. I like what they do in lots of UK restaurants: optional service charge, which it is quite ok to deduct from the bill, if you don't think the waiter deserves it. Or you can tip an amount you feel happy with (might be more, might be less).\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Can we go there only for desserts? :D\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Yes, you actually can! You can pay something like Rs. 1700+ I think and get unlimited starters and dessert (which I think is awesome).
