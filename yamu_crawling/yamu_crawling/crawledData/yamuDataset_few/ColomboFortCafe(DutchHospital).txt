yamu_review: ["Colombo Fort Cafe has\xa0been Malinthe's favourite place to get bacon burgers. Given that it's been eons since we'd checked it out, we dropped in for lunch last week. The ambience of the place was great, as was the dessert, but their mains left a bit to be desired.", "We started off with the Atomic Wings, which were a dozen spicy, red chicken wings at Rs. 825. It was completely coated in an incredibly hot sauce that packed heat enough to bring tears to your eyes. I loved the tanginess of the sauce, and it reminded me a bit of tabasco. There's no pretty way to dig into this dish, so ditch those forks and knives and just use your hands. Some people don't love this as the incredibly hot sauce just drowns out any meat or flavour.", 'For mains, I got the Grilled Seer Fish (Rs. 1750) and Dili got The Double or Nothing Burger (Rs. 800).', 'The burger was... massive. Quite worth the price, coming with a grilled beef patty and pulled pork. The beef patty was soft and succulent, but nothing to write home about. Dili said the pulled pork was pretty great and that he loved it, but rates the overall burger\xa0at 3/5. It was accompanied by a few potato wedges, which were hot, crispy, and quite brilliantly executed.', "I was rather disappointed with my grilled seer fish for its utter lack of flavour. The dish ideally should have been accompanied by a lemony sauce, which was lightly slathered on a corner of the plate instead (so you couldn't really dip your fish in it to compensate for the meat's blandness). The rice it came with was well, regular steamed rice. Quite nice, well made, but hey, it's plain rice.", 'We had a lime juice to wash it down, and wrapped our meal up with a Crème Brûlée. Priced at Rs. 275, the juice was refreshing and not too sweet, which we enjoyed.', 'The blow-torched caramel had hardened nicely and gave a satisfactory crack when the spoon made contact, and the custard just below it was intensely rich. At Rs. 400, this was a tad pricey but worth it.', "The staff were friendly, and quite efficient. We weren't kept waiting too long either and had an overall pleasant experience.", "With tall and surprisingly comfortable washed out pastel blue wooden furniture, warm yellow lights and brickwork, Colombo Fort Cafe is chilled out and great to hang around with a couple of friends. They've also got good music on, so it sets a laid-back mood.", "Would we go there again? Not for a meal.\xa0The taxes alone mounted to close to Rs. 1200, and our total was Rs. 5,441. The food isn't all that great and we can't really say that you get value for money. However, their ambience and location make it a great place for a beer and a chat!", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Colombo Fort Cafe is a lovely space with somewhat overrated food.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Colombo Fort Cafe is a Harpo's run restaurant located in the popular Dutch Hospital shopping complex, serving up delicious pizzas, pastas and burgers. \n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Colombo Fort Cafe is a Harpo run restaurant located in the popular Dutch Hospital shopping complex serving tapas, cocktails and general pub-grub fare\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    කලම්බු ෆෝට් කැෆේ කියන්නේ හර්පෝ විසින් කරන අවන්හලක්. ඒක තියෙන්නේ ජනප්\u200dරිය ඩච් හොස්පිටල් සාප්පු සංකීර්ණයේ. එකේ ටපැස්, කොක්ටේල් සහ පබ් වල තියෙන දේවල් අලෙවියට තියෙනවා.\n                                                                                                                            ']

So were the drinks. Fruit juice and cocktails were watery and tasteless, the Pepsi was watery and flat, and the food had absolutely no taste.

Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich as a replacement and there was way too much mayo and made it sickening to eat. I thought they should not have charged me for the sandwich, as courtesy for the spoilt burger but they did, but hey that's purely the managers choice. The Second time I went purely due to convenience (work at WTC) we had the Lamprais which was very ordinary and nothing to write home about.
