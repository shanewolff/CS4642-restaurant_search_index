Been like that for years and they simply don't care. Try queing up for anything in the evenings and try to catch a staff member's eye to attend to your order. They just ignore people or serve people they want to. You have to be tall, have a long arm and persuasive voice to get a waiter to pack your meal, after paying for it.

Kottu was also good. But once eaten you feel really thirsty. I concluded that they put some flavoring too much which makes us thirsty as a side effect. This happens especially with Kottu. Among all odds I still can't keep away from tasting their fried rice once in a while :). Alumka gives a large portion that would serve at least 2 people. I have tried some of their other stuff. The tastes and the portions seem to be worth for money. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    They use MSG\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    alumka the best…as far as i v knwn.', '\r\n15 minutes deal is usually happens when they cook food on the spot at that time.no pre mades …fried rice and kottu z a bomb…truely an amazing place…realy good service whn they do catering…\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I am a big time customer of Alumka.
