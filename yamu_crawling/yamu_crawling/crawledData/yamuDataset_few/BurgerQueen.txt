Just looking through the menu we could tell that this was more or less entirely inspired by the success of the King, with favourites like the chicken charly and the cordon blue available along with some interesting additions like the chicken fanan (which we aren't sure is available at the former).

While we can't really speak for consistency, their stuff wasn't half bad."]
