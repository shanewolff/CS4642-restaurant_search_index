name: Carnival Ice Cream Parlour
excerpt: Carnival is a Sri Lankan institution, serving not great but cheap ice cream in an accessible and interesting location.
yamu_review: ['Disclaimer: The new and refurbished Carnival looks nothing like the old Carnival.\xa0', "From the outside, it's a lot like Sri Lanka with Yahapalanaya - a lot hasn't been changed.", "But from inside,\xa0Carnival has gone through a complete face-lift. It's bigger and\xa0better, but\xa0not as cheap as before.", "No more canvas paintings of parrots and mohawks. No more rickety furniture. No more squeezing your way through to get your cone of ice cream.\xa0In terms of ambience, it's not the same old Carnival.", 'There are 3 large seating areas - \xa0one with red and white chairs, another with black and white chairs, and finally a brightly lit seating area with pastel coloured benches and a plethora of ice cream related frames.\xa0', 'The most sacred section - the one with the colouring overdose - is now more organized and less stuffy. You can now breathe as you wait for your stacked sundaes.', 'And service, in true Carnival style, was quick.\xa0', "Their menu\xa0has also had a facelift. It's no longer a long, yellow laminated sheet. Carnival has progressed. You are now presented a booklet with visuals of sundaes and shakes.", 'We opted for a Waffle Dream (Rs 430), Double Berry (Rs 550) and an Oreo Chill (Rs 550).', 'The Vanilla and Coffee ice cream tasted rich and bound well with the maple syrup. The waffle, weighing slightly on the rubbery side, was satisfying. When combined, it made for a great dessert. Definitely worth the 430 rupees!', 'A tall glass filled with strawberry compote, strawberry ice cream,\xa0canned peaches,\xa0topped with a generous whirl of whipped cream, sprinkles and a wafer was Double Berry. A very berry sugar attack. If you want to relive your childood filled with strawberry ice cream and sprinkles, but in a sophisticated style, Double Berry is what you are looking for.', "Avoid if you don't want a sugar rush. Or instant diabetes.", "You can't go wrong with an Oreo milkshake, right?\xa0Wrong.", "With no distinct Oreo taste coming through, this\xa0milkshake wasn't as\xa0thick as a milkshake should be and was rather disappointing overall.", 'For decades Carnival has been the go-to spot for affordable ice cream and with the recent renovations, they have\xa0really\xa0upped their game to stand as a well furnished and spacious\xa0ice cream parlour. However, their milkshakes can perform better.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Old spot, new interior, newer sundaes. \n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    This is the place to go for a number of flavours in one place.
