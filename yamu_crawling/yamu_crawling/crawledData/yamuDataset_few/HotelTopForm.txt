It just crap. I got a drumstick and there's nothing to eat except to eat the bone. Seems they have got it from an sick chicken. Even the rice is not good. I didn't complaint but thought never go there again.  It cost 260 and for that price there are plenty of places where you can buy good stuff.\n                                            "]
