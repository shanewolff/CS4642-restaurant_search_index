name: Sunlight Garden 
excerpt: Sunlight Garden is not one of the most popular Chinese restaurants in Colombo, but we don't really understand why. They've got good food, huge portions and great value for money.

I  went there with my wife and two children. The service was fine. Food was excellent. The value for money is maximum.  I planning to go again and try out their extensive menu. The small portion size was enough  for 4 regular eaters. The desserts are ordinary though with vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream. Ii suggest you skip it and go for more main food items.

Total came at Rs 2020 with taxes for 2. Food was below the average. Interior was smelly‚Ä¶ had to change the table because of it. We have tried Min Han, 168 and 88 and we love mainland Chinese food but Sunlight Garden is nowhere closer to them.
