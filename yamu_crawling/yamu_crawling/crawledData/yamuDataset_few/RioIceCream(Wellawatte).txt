name: Rio Ice Cream (Wellawatte) 
excerpt: Rio Ice Cream, a Jaffna franchise that's about forty years old (according to Raja at its Wellawatte branch), is idyllic and affordable for ice cream lovers - they're creative with flavours and mix it up for fun with jelly and smarties, because why not? 
yamu_review: ['If you\xa0want to get some ice cream while soaking in the beautiful sunset, Rio is the place to be.', "Jaffna's legendary, Rio, has been perched along Marine Drive for about four years now. While the taste remains the same (saccharine\xa0and surprisingly likeable), the prices have been hiked up a tad bit.", 'INFLATION? ECONOMIC CRISIS? PRICE MECHANISM? YAHAPALANAYA?\xa0', '\xa0', 'With a wide variety of ice cream flavours and milkshakes on their menu board, we opted for a Blueberry Sundae (Rs 230), a Mega Special (Rs 180),\xa0and a Badam Shake (Rs 300).', "This didn't taste like blueberries, but then again there are only 1 out of 2744275430 (please adjust for hyperbole)\xa0Sri Lankans who have actually tasted real blueberries. (Ones on cheesecakes do NOT count.)\xa0", 'You don\'t really realize the ice cream does not have a strong blueberry taste until you go, "hmm, this tastes very blueberry-ish, but, hmmm, I haven\'t really had real blueberries... HOLY MOTHER OF ICE CREAMS THIS IS TRICKING MY BRAIN BECAUSE IT\'S SWEET VANILLA WITH A SLIGHT BLUEBERRY FLAVOR AND LOTS OF LIGHT VIOLET COLOURING... but this is pretty darn good," and you end up downing it like beer.', "If you're Muslim, like Barbican because #HalalLife.", "If you like telling people what to do, don't get the Rio Mega Special. You won't have a say in the flavour of ice creams in the sundae. Either way, this sundae is loaded with jelly, smarties (which I am assuming are Ritzbury Pebbles), and nuts. Not too many nuts, but enough nuts. You will also come across some fruit here and there. So it's kinda healthy, I\xa0guess.", "A little too sweet for my liking because it comes at\xa0you all at once. With overpowering sweetness,\xa0Rio's Mega Special is only for the Mega Strong.", "Badam Shake (Badam = Almonds in Hindi)\xa0was a little disappointing. I expected a thick milkshake, but what I got was one with a watery consistency. I refuse to call this a Badam shake. It was a lot like badam milk, but not as tasty as how badam milk usually is. Very diluted in taste and a little too expensive for something that I wouldn't go back to buying.", '\xa0', 'This place is packed to the brim in the evenings. You would be surprised at the number of people who want to eat ice cream on a Tuesday at 4 PM.', 'The crowd is what really highlights the place. Rio is constantly buzzing, with\xa0people celebrating birthdays to soon-to-become aunties taking little kids to eat some ice cream, to old uncles who just want some sweetness in their system.\xa0', 'Service is a little slow given the continuous crowds. If you are dying and you really want ice cream, ditch Rio because they\xa0will take about 10 minutes.', "On the whole, you won't receive a smile most of the time with your ice cream. But do you really need that smile?", '\xa0', 'The ice cream is very, very sweet, but if you are not weak and your body can deal with it, go ahead and try Rio.', 'Take. The. Challenge.\xa0', 'Eat.
