To be halaal certified the place in question has to submit a request/invitation to the relevant authorities. The authorities do not go around asking or demanding places be halaal certified. This seems to be a common misconception. Another condition regarding the attainment of the halaal certificate is that none of the branches of the franchise in question should serve or use non-permitted ingredients. An example of this would be Bread Talk. Although their Park Street branch does not use pork they still won't be able to get the certificate simply due to the fact that their other branches do. Just because a place doesn't have the certificate doesn't mean it's not halaal.
