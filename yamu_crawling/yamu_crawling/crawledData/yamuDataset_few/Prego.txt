name: Prego
excerpt: Prego is an Italian restaurant in Negombo. Although the prices are high, the food is quite authentic and the ambience is chilled out. 
yamu_review: ["An Italian joint down Poruthota Road in Negombo, Prego offers a variety of pizzas, pastas, rice, and meats. It's a\xa0pretty nice place with very friendly staff and a chilled-out ambience.\xa0They also have a range of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.", "The staff are really attentive and friendly. They ushered us to our seats, put our dying-out camera batteries to charge with a smile on their faces (didn't make me feel like I was bothering them), and patiently waited until we made up our indecisive minds about what to order. The food took a little while to arrive — about half an hour to 45 minutes — but the items were served hot and fresh. The food tasted good,\xa0so the wait was worthwhile.", "Although their food is tasty, it's also pricey,\xa0with barely anything to be found for less than a thousand bucks.\xa0I ordered a\xa0petti di pollo\xa0(grilled chicken breast smothered in mushroom sauce with a few slices of grilled bell pepper) for Rs. 1,500, and my friend ordered the salmone\xa0(smoked salmon) pizza (Rs. 1,600). We also got a watermelon juice and an orange juice, each at Rs. 300.", "The watermelon juice\xa0tasted fresh. I'm usually not a huge fan of it, because it tends to be watered down. The flavour of the\xa0orange juice was strong and tangy. It wasn't\xa0doused with sugar,\xa0so I really appreciated that. Also, it was served chilled — very refreshing on a sunny, ", ' day.', 'I thought the chicken was overpriced, given that it was just the meat. That being said, we really liked how the mushroom sauce complemented the well-prepared chicken.', "We were also offered a little vial of olive oil, which we didn't use 'cause the dish had plenty. The chicken was soft with the outside crisped to a light gold, and although it seemed like\xa0quite a small serving, it was a filling dish.", 'The\xa0salmon pizza\xa0had thick, pink slices of smoked salmon scattered across the dough, which was layered with mozarella and what seemed to be dollops of oregano paste. The flavour of the fish was quite strong and while I found it overpowering, my friend said it was fine. I loved how you unexpectedly bit into the spice and flavour of the oregano — it added a pleasant dash of non-fishy flavour to a very fishy pizza.', "The restaurant is spacious and well laid out.\xa0Tables with\xa0chairs are\xa0on the right and others with benches are on the left. There's a wooden statue right in the middle, and cutlery hanging on the ceiling above the counter. The place is dimly and relies mostly on natural lighting. There's also an al fresco area outside.", 'It is neat and chilled out. We liked it.', "Prego is an expensive place, albeit good for a special occassion. The food is filling, the pizzas are worth the price, and the staff are friendly and full of smiles. It's quiet during weekday lunch hours, so it's a place to seek out\xa0if you want some peace.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Prego (which means 'you are welcome' in Italian) dishes out pricey but flavoursome Italian cuisine that doesn't disappoint.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Prego is an Italian restaurant in Negombo.
