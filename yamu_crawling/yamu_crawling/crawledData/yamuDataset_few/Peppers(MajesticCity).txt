name: Peppers (Majestic City)
excerpt: Over the weekend I found myself wandering about Majestic City doing a bit of shopping. After a couple of tiresome hours of trying to find a gift, I hungrily dragged myself to the spacious, although somewhat crowded, Majestic City food court. They offer a good variety of food to choose from; there’s a Pizza Hut, KFC, Magic Corn, Juice by Roots, Chinese and Mongolian food stalls, and there’s even a small pastry shop in the corner. Personally though, the main feature would have to be Peppers – Pizza and Pasta.

Its NOT pizza, its a pita bread painted with an artificial sweet red sauce and lil shreds of chicken. If ur hungry at MC U can do better with 150 bucks for ur hunger. Like the shop where chariot used to be on the ground floor (opposite com bank ATM), don't know its name, they serve hearty wraps, sams sausages, hot dogs and stuff. They have a big serving of ice cream cones for just 50 bucks. Thats the place for a quick snack. Also there are foot-long burger stall on the basement floor which is decent, tho Im not a fan of boiled-ungrilled sausages.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Agree. Peppers is pretty bad. They do that local thing where the tomato sauce is sickly sweet on the pizza-gross.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    ^ totally agree with HitActionCop, if you are going to try Peppers you r wasting your money … and that Shop,opposite com bank ATM ( I also can not remember the name) serves yummy Milk shakes too,\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Peppers has been there for as long as I remember… and while not stellar food, I've rather enjoyed their pasta and pizza.

I've had their spicy chicken macaroni for 60/- or so those days and while it was no where close to a perfect pasta dish, it was wholly satisfying if you wanted some grub.", "\r\nAgain, not a place where you'd go for gourmet delicacies, but simple, tasty hunger busters.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Totally agree with the review… MC food court is a place you'd dine in if you are either starving or just about gots no other place to go! However, from all the restaurants there my personal favorite is Peppers not cuz of the pizza (cuz I'm not a pizza fan in general) but the yummy pasta! Guess it depends on your palette but that pasta is well worth the 220-230 bucks you pay.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Super Pizza since i was a kid\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Love their Pizza! :) \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Believe it or not, the pizza here is quite good.

It's almost like they use cheap sweetened tomato sauce from a bottle for the topping, the cheese is not really mozzarella, (but I'll let them have that cos it's very cheap. but it doesn't stretch), sometimes it's cold, and they top it with really dry tasteless chicken. I'd call it flat bread with sweetened bottled tomato sauce, cheese substitute and chicken left overs. :) but hey for Rs. 150 what more can you ask for right? \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    not that great, it's cheap. that's all\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I would always love their Rice with Sausages. love the huge amount of mayonnaise over the salad.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Had quick lunches from there so many times and for the price you can't ask for better. Peppers don't have the best food. But if you are hungry and under a budget it would do.

Cussing peppers for not being a proper pizza joint is like cussing your mother when she tries to make her version of KFC or something. Its been that shop in the corner for as long as I remember and giving school kids and "empty pocket" boys and girls a happily decent meal. They don\'t pretend. Its like Green Cabin, its not the best, but when you long for that particular taste, there is only one place to go to.

Always liked that they haven't changed in over 20 years. Even the staff! The pizza is feel good food and so is the pasta. It has a home-made style to it by a local's standards anyways. It's not meant to be pizza the Italian way. For the nay sayers: Point taken - it's not luxury dining that you obviously expect in a food court (sarcasm) - head to the spot at Liberty Arcade 2nd floor ^^ instead of taking it out on the little guy that kept his business going for all of 19+ years?\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Love this place !
