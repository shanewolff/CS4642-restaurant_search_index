name: Echo (Cinnamon Grand)
excerpt: Colombo wants for good Italian options. While there’s no lack of Italian restaurants none of them quite does justice to the real gusti d’italia  It’s not that Bayleaf, Il Ponte, Echo are bad exactly – just that they aren’t quite good enough. On occasion though Colombo’s wannabe trattorias can surprise you with the quality of their cooking. The other day we stepped into Echo and discovered they serve up a very respectable anti pasti buffet for Rs. 1200+.

Now, lunch has a good buffet, but a tiny selection of main dishes, we each had pasta, small dishes and small portions. The service was non-existent, we had to beg for service when we wanted anything. \n                                            ']
