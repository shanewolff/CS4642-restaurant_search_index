user_comments: ["\n\n                                    We were there, first burger was cold and we gave it back, after 5 minutes we got a second one steaming hot (even the salad) pretty sure it was microwaved even my kids hated it. Didn't send it back because this would have been the second time but should have. So really disappointed. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I love BK… I'm a regular at their Rajagiriya outlet and I love their thick cut french fries which are always crispy and fresh. Their beef burgers are a notch above McDs in my humble opinion…much fresher and tastier and the service is very good or at least they try and are always cheerful in greeting you and taking your order. Thumbs up!\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Went there a few weeks ago and disappointed me just as much as the last time. The lettuce was so limp you'd think that too came from the US. Wish they had the quad stack but I'm not sure whether it's still early days. Agree to disagree but these burgers feel like they cost the same as places like Barnesbury or Commons but half the size. Still kinda disappointed with BK.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    To be honest, Burger King do not meet the customer expectorations. We pay price and the quality is zero, I can recall my memory on the start-up days of BK - SL and still I dont think we eat burgers @ BK-SL, Plus just like other franchised partners just as they do, BK-SL has forgotten  the business that they entered, Saw "King Rice" product and feel "Sri Lankan Buriyani transition Hurricane" already blow BK-SL also.

If a customer wants to avoid it, they can simply not have it as an add on. What would happen if the hindus demand that beef should be removed as well? But they don't.

Cos of the calories :)", '\n', "\nUnfortunately though… The one time i had it at the colpetty store… It Wasn't that great… In fact… It was terrible.

The bun was tasting old and flaky. breaks apart like old buns. Whereas Mc Donalds give super exellent quality buns. No complaints at all. Also burger king meat was not tasting fresh.
