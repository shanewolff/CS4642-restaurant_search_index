excerpt: Cioconat offers some tasty, generous fare, but even so it still isn’t exactly where it could be.

yamu_review: ["So we've all been to Cioconat and had our own unique experiences that we've somehow managed to supress and not make a big deal out of.\xa0", "\r\nThey try really hard to do a lot of different things at once in terms of cuisine, which I appreciate, but then in the midst of all the confusion their execution isn't exactly excellent.", 'I felt like some spaghetti so I got the Spicy Meatballs with Beef\xa0(Rs. 800) and the picture clearly indicated that the pasta would be spaghetti but unfortunately they served it with Penne instead. There were also two slices of garlic bread which were crispy and tasted great.', "\r\nThere are about 5 large meatballs which looked like they'd been prepared well resting on a plate of slightly undercooked Penne. I was pleased with the minimal amount of sauce but of course all the sauce was at the bottom and once you're done with the pasta on the top it gets difficult to eat since it's all drenched in sauce.", '\r\nThe meatballs however tasted wonderful but as I got to my 2nd, I realise it was a little raw. Forking through the rest of them in panic, it turned out most of them were a little raw. Why. Overall a bit of a mediocre dish that looked pretty.\xa0', "Rajeev got the Con Pollo (Rs. 750) which looked rather alarmingly unimpressive but tasted great. It was served with a lot of chips which I appreciate, and the chips weren't bad and actually came close to Mickey D's without all the extra grease.", "\r\nThe bread was a little dry but not too much to complain about. The filling consisted of chicken, carrots, onion and perhaps some mayonnaise or dressing of sorts. There was also a generous bit of pepper but to my surprise it didn't kill the rest of the elements in the sandwich.", 'We got one of their Brownies (Rs. 490) for takeaway and according to Aisha it was alright, quite a big portion but felt more like a square piece\xa0of cake than a brownie. Not worth the price given how cakey and slightly dry it was.', "We had to wait a while before Rajeev decided to take one of their funky little 'Call' buttons that you press to summon the waiter. Even after that it still took about 10 minutes, but the waiters were quite friendly and efficient. They even took the time to ask how our meal was, which I give them a plus for.", 'Since they were trying to accomplish so much they sort of got lost with their interior decor. There was no specific set theme, and they had a bright theme going with standard diner furniture.', "\r\nThere's an area outside for all those who wish to partake in some Shisha and it's very dingy, usually full of gents eyeballing everything that moves. Quite nice.", '\xa0', "Okay so if you're on a budget don't go here because the prices and tax charges are ridiculously high. If you have some cash to spend then fine, but don't order the Spaghetti.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Cioconat has steadily descended down the hill of progress and we're disappointed to report that they're at a stagnant standstill at the moment.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Cioconat offers some tasty, generous fare, but even so it still isn’t exactly where it could be.\r\n\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    We could never quite bring ourselves to explore Cioconat, the coffee shop lurking behind all the unsightly coffee-and-ash cladding on Barnes Place.

Yay :) ', '\r\n', '\r\nWhen I went with my whole family (8 people all together) they were very accommodating, gave us the little private room and the food was a large portion of stuff, including salads, pizza, pasta and I forget, it has been a few months now. I was pleasantly surprised and compared to all the other places I frequent, I waled away thinking I would love to get my friends together sometime for some quiet chilling and good conversation. I am sorry I did not get to try this hot chocolate and I will certainly go back again. Maybe organize a gathering next week! :) ', '\r\n', "\r\nIf I had anything to say, it was the salad (sorry I forget what I got) but I would have preferred the dressing on the side, but otherwise, I had nothing to complain about. Thanks to Yamu, i'm definitely going to check it out - and just a quick reminder, reviews do not necessarily need to be objective and it really is up to the reader to keep an open mind, read between the lines - and after all, remember Yamu  is a free service and CIOCONAT responded - overall it works really well.

A few hiccups in the service need to be sorted out , 1)needed to switch to Sinhala to be understood 2) informed quite abruptly the they were out of penne pasta (on a day they could reasonably expect more pasta orders) and 3) not told that the carbonara was beef untill asked (no mention on the menu although carbonara is traditionally pork)', '\r\n', '\r\nThat said, the pasta was amazing! Good hearty portions, thick creamy sauce, crunchy french bread and generous scattering of Parmesan.
