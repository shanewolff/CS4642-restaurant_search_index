name: Min Han
excerpt: Min Han (or Ming Han) is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants. It's cheap, super tasty and the waiter Wijapayala orders for you.
yamu_review: ["Since I started this review I've actually gone to Min Han (or Ming Han) four times. The food is consistently excellent and quite cheap (you can happily eat for Rs. 1,000 per person) and Wijayapala - the main waiter - is a character. The ambience is somewhat basic and dingy, but we love this place.", "At Min Han I've actually given up on using the menu at all. There's one waiter - Wijayapala - and we just let him make recommendations. That is, we mention a protein (say prawn) and he says the Japanese style prawn is good, and it is. That's the prawn above, these are fat prawns, popping with sweet flavor. The downside of this menu is you don't know prices, but everything is a maximum of Rs. 680 for a small (which serves about four).", "One classic we always get is their cuttlefish. It's not hot buttered exactly, it's a different lighter style but always quite good.", 'Their sweet potato leaves are also nice, and a good alternative to kankun. These veggie dishes are usually around Rs. 300.', "Of the people that work there, Wijaypala seems to be the only one that speaks English or Sinhalese. Hence he's the waiter for any locals that come in. Usually the rest of the clientele is Chinese, but it varies. He's a charming guy but may rub you the wrong way if you're used to just ordering and having someone take it down. He will change your order if he doesn't like it. That to us is part of the charm of the place.", "The interior is simple to be generous. It's all pink tables and chairs, the former covered in plastic. They have two private rooms and Chinese TV is always on. If you're trying to impress with ambience, this isn't the place, but we think it's fun. You can wear shorts and slippers and just have a nice meal and a good time with friends.", 'We love Min Han, Ming Han, whatever you want to call it. This humble Chinese restaurant does really tasty and affordable food and is always a fun night out. The waiter Wijayapala is a Colombo institution and so, in our opinion, in Min Han.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    We love Min Han, Ming Han, whatever you want to call it.

Sadly though, hardly any of \'em serve truly authentic Chinese cuisine, with most establishments serving up what has now been named "Sri lankanized Chinese".
