yamu_review: ['Café Shaze is one of Colombo’s many café/restaurant/lounge options, this time in the increasingly bustling neighborhood of Thimbirigasyaya. The café is actually quite big, they do some good Western dishes, and the prices are on par with most cafes in the city.', 'The menu includes a typical range of Western preparations of meats, seafood, pastas and so on. We got ourselves the beef stroganoff and the seafood pasta, for Rs. 850 and Rs. 950.', 'The portions were average, and both dishes were well prepared. The beef was tender and coupled with flat-noodle pasta, a thin gravy and cheese, and the seafood dish was very flavoursome featuring chunky prawns and cuttlefish. The food though not amazing, is good. And nearly Rs. 1000 seems like a lot for the portion, but this seems to be the expected rate at big cafes that have the same vibe.', 'The drinks here are for around Rs. 450. We got a strawberry flavoured mojito and a ‘Shaze milkshake’ which was promised to taste of milk toffee. The mojito was alright, very sweet and with that fresh hit of mint and lime, but the Shaze milkshake was basically just a sweet vanilla milkshake.', 'We then got the crème brulee for fun for Rs. 350. And nobody gets crème brulee perfect (we did have ', ' once though), so this was no exception, but it was still tasty, because hot custard FTW.', 'Café Shaze gets points for its ambience, much like most sleek upper-end coffee shops and cafes. It’s more a place you visit to hang out with a few friends on comfy leather sofas, than to sample the food and drinks. It’s actually bigger than it seems when you walk in – besides the main lounging area, there are inner rooms for privacy, more formal dining and outdoor spaces too.', "Service was quite good during our visit, with a very attentive manager and waiter and the dishes arriving soon. Also, Shaze runs a little clothing store next to it which is accessible from the cafe space - mostly casual men's clothing, and we spotted some imported Star Wars themed t-shirts in the Rs. 2000 range.", "Café Shaze serves some decent dishes and drinks and the prices aren't too bad by Colombo's cafe standards (meals, drinks and a dessert included, it cost us Rs. 3000 for two). If you're in the neighborhood with friends and looking for an easy hangout, this is a convenient option.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Cafe Shaze is another one of Colombo's many cafe-restaurant-lounges.

Shaze is very very new. Give it some time and try it out for yourself.
