yamu_review: ['Boat Haus Cafe has been a popular seafood spot among Mount Lavinians for a while now. They offer fresh seafood and classic deviled dishes, all of it at pretty reasonable rates.', "Boat Haus Cafe is one of the many beachside restaurants on Mount Lavinia beach and one of the less dodgy. While there's actually no seafood on the printed menu, you can point to what you like at the fresh seafood counter.", "They get a fresh catch everyday and the prices are pretty good. Authentic seafood-wise, it doesn't get much better than this. Once you pick what you'd like, they also prepare it the way you want (grilled, steamed, pan-fried, batter-fried, etc).", "We got 150g of grilled seer fish (Rs. 570), which was basically the size of a small steak. While the preparation was simple, it still tasted great - due to the freshness of the fish. It was slightly under seasoned for my taste but nothing a bit of salt and pepper couldn't fix.", 'We also tried out their version of hot butter cuttlefish (Rs. 270 for 100g) which was different from the conventional "Chinese" preparation but still quite enjoyable. The cuttlefish was extremely fresh with a batter that was slightly thicker than usual but still crunchy and well seasoned with a bit of heat from the chilli flakes.', "The tiger prawns looked so inviting at the counter that we got some pan fried in garlic sauce (Rs. 290 for 100g). In terms of flavour the garlic didn't come through quite as well as we would have liked but we still happily finished the entire dish since the prawns themselves tasted so great.", "For a change of pace we also tried out their deviled pork (Rs. 450 for S). This was a classic deviled preparation with tons of chilli, coarsely chopped tomatoes, onions and capsicums. They use curry pork so you're not going to find as many pieces of fat, but since curry pork is relatively cheap, they give you a hefty portion which is more than enough for two. Honestly can't think of a better accompaniment for a Lion lager.", "Boat Haus Cafe is pretty much a house by the beach that has been converted into a restaurant. They've got seating both inside and on the beach, so they can accommodate quite a decent crowd. The interior has a brick floor which is quite rare nowadays and gives it an old(ish) look. They leave the large front doors open so you can enjoy the view of the beach even during the warmer times of the day. The only issue is that the strong breeze tends to blow the red-white checkered tablecloths all over the place which can get a bit annoying.", "The service at BHC was quite fast but also highly unprofessional. They've got a staff of mostly young waiters, who happen to have the attention span of goldfish. We found ourselves waving our hands around quite a bit and the waiter who saw would tell another, and that one would call someone else. It reminded us of siblings who try and get the other to do chores.", "Boat Haus Cafe is a great choice if you're looking to grab some fresh seafood by the beach. The service can be trying at times, but we still think it's a good spot.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Boat House Cafe is a great choice if you're looking to grab some fresh seafood by the beach.
