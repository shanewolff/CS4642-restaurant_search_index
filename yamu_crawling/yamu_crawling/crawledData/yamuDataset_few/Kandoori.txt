yamu_review: ["Kandoori's got some pretty legit biriyani, and we love it. Their food is a bit on the pricey side, with meals crossing over Rs 600, but given the quality we think it's worth it.", 'While the service is a bit on the slow end, the staff are quite friendly. Food-wise, we went for a Mutton Biryani (Rs. 760) and a Makhani Paneer (Rs. 780). And then we decided to get some Devilled Beef (Rs. 420) as well.', "We don't have\xa0any complaints where quality is concerned. Fragrant, well spiced basmati rice and generous pieces of mutton dotted this biriyani. Our only gripe was that the portion could have been larger, for the price.", 'The Makhani Paneer was super creamy, both the gravy and the paneer itself.', 'A bit on the oily side, but delicious.', "The beef was also well done. It isn't your traditional devilled beef, which comes dry: this was swimming in gravy and spice.\xa0We didn't like it as much as we enjoyed the biriyani and the paneer, but it's good in its own right — and should probably have been paired with something bready like naan.", "Kandoori is spacious, well-lit and clean. There wasn't much of a crowd\xa0when we visited, but it can easily hold large groups of people. It's a good place for an outing which involves great biriyani.", "YAMU's been here a few times and their food is consistently good. Service could improve a bit I reckon, in terms of being a bit more efficient and quick, but they're friendly and pleasant so it's not too bothersome.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Kandoori's got some pretty legit biriyani, and we love it.\xa0\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Kandoori is an Indian restaurant that serves just biriyani and other Indian food.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හැබැයි මට්න් නම් තොගයයි.\r\nකාලා බලමුකො! එක පාර මට්න් කෑලි දෙකක් හැන්දට ගත්ත මම හෙමින් සැරේ රස බැලුවා.\r\n“මාර වැඩේ! මට්න්වලින් මට්න් රහක් එන්නෑ  කියන්නකො.\n                                                                                                                            ']

Then I spoke to the manager ( appears to be a thug) who was very rude and said some people are waiting 45 minutes for their orders. He said if we are ready to wait foranother 45minutes he will take the order. He was talking as we have come to eat for free and didn't show any respect to customers. In my opinion this place should not be given even 1 point for their service. Terrible service…\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    The best mutton biriyani… value for money too.
