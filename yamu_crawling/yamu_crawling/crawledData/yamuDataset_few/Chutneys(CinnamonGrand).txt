The menu can get a bit tricky to navigate. Desserts were underwhelming.\n                                    ', '\n                                            Well, I love this place. I have tried mostly everything from dosas to appams, rotis to paranthas. In love with their salted lassi. \n                                    ', '\n                                            great food… only if they could work on their preparation time… I.e reduce it from 40 mins to about 20.\n                                    ']
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    Portions are too small and not very tasty as well. Curries like mutton or vegs are very small and one portion is not even enough for a single person. Portions are filled with gravy but no pieces. Veg buriyani is okay with the price you pay for it. Maybe its a good place to try indian food like thosas and naan but certainly not worth it to try other stuff.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I hate the dress code requirements at some SL hotels. I can understand if they want to have a dress code at a nice place like London Grill. ', "\r\nBut once I was staying at Hotel Riverina and heading to the dinner buffet. At the door they mentioned that I needed pants (no shorts allowed). Really…. first of all it's a beach resort where you go to relax, not Ritz-Carlton.

I like authentic SL curry and rice myself. But, it was a different experience. It's South Indian and my pallet didn't enjoy the food 100%. Flat breads were good. Its an experience for people who place Sinhalese food and south Indian food in the same bucket!! Because there is a significant different manner of flavor in Sinhalese rathu kakulu bath with lovely kiri hodi, abul thiyal and maldive fish sambal. Just my opinion. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Disagree with this review. Their dosas and curries are no where as good as some of the other South Indian restaurants in Colombo notably Shanmugs.

Great food but the quantity was irritating.  Four people came to Rs 90,000 and two split a main course . No booze just water and tea. The Chowhound Hound can't call this a Chowhound find, it lacks value. Best dish was an appetizer, called Prawn  Andra Pradesh.  I am not sure I can be as generous with four stars. Perhaps, if I got the other half of the meal we ordered. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    A good place to have south indian food.  I tried nandu rasam after reading this and yap it was good :) well, when it comes to size of the portion ofcourse it is not that big, but still it is worth the price. I love the at,osphere and the friendly service too. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I took my mother here for her birthday (lunch) last year.

We ate well, and they even packed up the leftovers in a nice paper bag for us to take-away. Kind of on the high side price-wise, but wonderful atmosphere, and we did eat a lot… so that's fair.
