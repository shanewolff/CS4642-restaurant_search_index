Kudos to the management for maintaining such an awesome place !! \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Visited this place yesterday and it doesn't quite live up to the review anymore. The review is 2 years old, so that explains it. It's an OK place, a bit far from nice and neat. If you're really starving, this is a place to grab a quick snack but not a cool place to hang out for a long time. The smell of fish was unbearable even inside the restaurant, so we settled with a take-away order. The Swiss Apple Cake was nice and filling which was about Rs.300+. Overall, I will not pay a second visit.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I didnt like my experience over there. They served us cakes which were not fresh at all. And The cappuccino I had , was so strong I couldnt even drink it. The management should look in to the staff who were not friendly at all. Not even a smile to say hello. ', '\r\nI will not pay a second visit. \n                                            ']
