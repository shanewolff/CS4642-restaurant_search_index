excerpt: Authentic and affordable food, complete with a chef who knows his dishes.
yamu_review: ["Momo's by Ruvi started its adventure with\xa0great fanfare\xa0less than a year ago and quickly became Colombo\xa0institution for dumplings.\xa0For those who missed the buzz, Momo's by Ruvi is\xa0a tiny quaint restaurant\xa0hidden in a narrow lane\xa0opposite Majestic City\xa0that exclusively sells\xa0momos, these dumplings originated from Tibet.", 'We visited them during their opening week in April this year and were sold. We thought it was about time to\xa0check if they were still living up to their reputation.', "First, you'll have to settle on the cooking style, as momos can either be steamed, shallow fried or wok fried. Second, you'll have to think about the filling: veggies, chicken, beef or prawn.\xa0", "Or, if you're hesitant or, like us,\xa0want to try everything, go for a platter. The Meaty Fiesta (Rs. 1,250) enables you to choose 2 meats that will be cooked in all 3\xa0ways, while the Platter (from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,200 depending on the meat)\xa0features a single type of meat prepared following the 3 possible methods. Note that a\xa0platter should fill you up.\xa0\xa0", "Now that's the somehow confusing ordering part is done, let's enjoy the goodies!", "On our last visit, we've tried most of the momos on the menu and\xa0they were all equally delicious! The flimsy\xa0dough held\xa0generous and juicy fillings, mixes of veggies, meat if any and herbs. They were all\xa0really delicate and so\xa0flavoursome. Spot on!", 'Fillings are the same regardless of the cooking style. The steamed momos are the plain\xa0and most delicate ones, the wok fried cooking brings some texture and interesting crunch\xa0to the delicacy, while\xa0the shallow fried version, coated in a delicious\xa0spicy sauce, is the richest option.\xa0', "It would be really hard to rank them. But for the sake of it and for you Yamu readers, we'll do it. And the winner\xa0is...\xa0Shallow Fried Chicken Momos, very closely followed by the Steamed Prawn Momos, and\xa0all the other options.", "There honestly wasn't a single thing we didn't like on our plates. The homemade chili & soy\xa0and sambol sauces were also very nice and pleasantly accentuated the flavours of the dumplings.\xa0", "We also gave a go to the only non-momo-ey item on the menu,\xa0the Stir Fried Bok Choy (Rs. 230), served in soy sauce and sprinkled\xa0with crunchy garlic and chili flakes. And we didn't regret it. It made a fresh and spicy add-on to our meal.", "Momo's by Ruvi is no fancy place and they don't try to look or act like one either, and we really like this attitude. They're here to make momos and they do it well. Full stop.", "The restaurant can accommodate\xa0about 15 to 20 diners max at a time in\xa0one\xa0cramped room. It's not very private as you can imagine and we wouldn't recommend it\xa0to discuss confidential stuff or to declare your love to your crush. Unless you're very confident about your date or/and don't care about other people participating to it.", "While we aren't big fans of the quaint decoration, we acknowledge and appreciate the effort to make the place feel\xa0warm and cosy. Plus, it's very neat and clean.", 'While ordering was a bit of a confusing process (but maybe more on our side I have to admit), the rest flowed smoothly and the first platter arrived\xa0pretty quickly. The person assuring the service on that day was welcoming and discreet.', "We're glad to confirm that Momo's by Ruvi is living up to the hype. Dumpling lovers, you're in for a treat! And for a fair price. Dumpling haters, go on your way, this place isn't for you!", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A cosy little place overflowing with momos and quirky decoration. \n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Authentic and affordable food, complete with a chef who knows his dishes.\n                                                                                                                            ']

I mean, I was literally few feets away from him and he was roaming around the fridge full of water bottles all the time.  In a way, it's understandable because he seems determined to play his circusy gimmick with each and every bottle for 10-15 seconds before he deliver them to nearby tables. Really?
