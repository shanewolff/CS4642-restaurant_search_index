excerpt: We dropped in at the Java Lounge in Bambalapitiya the other day, and it's actually pretty good. They've got an accessible location, good coffee and some awesome desserts.

I\'ve seen you guys reduce stars for just being too dry. Honestly!!!!', '\r\nTheir sandwiches are absolutely average. What do you guys base some of these ratings on?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    We didn\'t say the bread was inedible or that it had gone bad. If you noticed that was our only real complain, besides that everything else was good. Our ratings are based on personal experience, and I\'d go there again. At the end of day this outlet is supposed to be a "grab a quick coffee and go" kind of place, and it does that pretty well.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    It'd be good if a coffee shop is being reviewed, to have a coffee also… Not the iced mixed drink stuff, but an espresso or cappuccino etc. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Espresso here was decent the 2nd time I went. The first it was terrible, like they\'d burnt it and made it with coffee beans ground way too fine. Tried a Latte out of curiosity, which supposedly contains 2 espressos - it clearly didn\'t given how milky it was. On the plus side they didn\'t bother me while I was working aways on my laptop although the Wifi was terrible and I was forced to share the internet off my phone. Overall, this is the perfect modern "cafe" terrible coffee but has that "ambience" that hipsters crave for a catch-up or first date.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Another place we drop by frequently and we love it. Especially a great place for quick business meetings for 2 or 3 people. Service is good and food is also fine.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I find the service at this outlet terrible. The order might be delivered on time, but the staff is nothing short of rude. Since hospitality is my number one, when grading a coffee shop, I think it deserves quite less than one star.\n                                            ']
