The new management has a policy against people sharing food. I have been going there for a long time and have never heard of a minimum table tab or anti-sharing policy. I understand if the rules are new, but then they must be displayed in public, on the menu or conveyed to customers before taking the order. The Manager was rude in responding to my query and stated bluntly that he didn't care if we left. Disappointed that such an establishment of repute is run by Management that not only breaches customer information rights, but also treats them with disrespect.\n                                    ", '\n                                            ', '\n                                    ', '\n                                            We went here on Sunday and loved it!
