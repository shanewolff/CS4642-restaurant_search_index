excerpt: The new Kaema Sutra, moved from its previous premises in Arcade Independence to the plush Shangri La, still serves decent-ish food at high prices  
yamu_review: ['At the new Kaema Sutra at the Shangri La hotel,\xa0valet parking and\xa0people treating you like a VIP comes with\xa0the package. But was the food worth the money?', "Kaema Sutra's new premises incorporates a whole wall covered in devil\xa0masks, grinning, feral faces stare you down as you enjoy an expensive night out with friends, family or business associates. As frightening as this may sound, the effect is actually a nice one.\xa0", 'The interior is also thoughtfully and plushly decorated in soft brown shades, and very comfortable, down to the swiveling chairs at the bar that somehow combine the efficiency of a barstool with the comfort of an armchair. Even the big screens behind the bar, tuned into a permanently frozen football match, a superhero action flick\xa0and an old cricket match respectively while we were there, somehow seemed to blend in well with the overall accent of the place.', 'There is also outside seating, though this removes you from the aforementioned ambience. But the great views and fresh breeze more than make\xa0up for it.\xa0', "The menu\xa0is\xa0simple and doesn't give you a mindboggling array of choices that will leave you scratching your head.\xa0", 'Kaema Sutra offers a range of tropical cocktails, which come in\xa0mugs that are....sourced from Africa. Apparently South-South cultural appropriation is OK? We got some\xa0wine (rather overpriced at Rs. 2,200 for a glass of Spi Valley)\xa0and the Zombie Raksha (Rs 850) which was not quite as terrifying as it sounds. It had a base of rum and fruits, with a generous dose of vanilla liquer. A little too generous in fact, it was pleasant and sweet but kept reminding us\xa0of cough syrup.', '*All prices without\xa0service charge and taxes*', "There's a range of 'Sri Lankan tapas' to choose from as a starter. We chose the Rotti Pizza with 'Baby Jackfruit' (Rs. 600) a.k.a\xa0polos.\xa0The polos was cooked just right, and the gravy is just juicy enough to complement the rotti dough without being too drippy. As an overall experiment though, this pizza didn't end up impressing us too much. It was basically like eating polos curry with rotti, which is not something you would\xa0usually do\xa0anyway, unless it was Leftover Night.", 'The Black Hopper (Rs. 500) is basically a hopper made from\xa0batter doused in squid ink. It comes with soft buffalo curd, sprinkled with salt crystals, and olive oil on the side. It had the\xa0potential to be\xa0excellent, but ended up\xa0being only good because it\xa0was served a little\xa0cold. The squid ink adds a flavor that is nicely complemented by the whipped\xa0curd, which has a consistency slighly more substantial than whipped cream. Excellent for digging into with a peice of hopper.', 'The plain hopper (Rs. 250) was just a regular hopper\xa0with a small side of\xa0', 'It is\xa0a little bigger than the kadey variety though.\xa0', "The Australian Mutton Curry (Rs. 1100)\xa0wasn't spectacular, but\xa0wasn't terrible either. I think the word I'm looking for here is 'average'.", "The crab stringhopper kottu (Rs 600) however, shined like a beacon of brilliance in an otherwise not too thrilling night (except for the dessert but we'll get to that later).\xa0\xa0The crab meat blended in seamlessly with the texture of the stringhoppers, and the gravy was soft and peppery, but not too spicy.", "We capped off the evening with What the Hopper (Rs. 600), their signature dessert. It's a crunchy\xa0", '\xa0(treacle hopper) with a generous helping of whipped curd (I must say that this is a hit), chopped strawberry (very fresh) and treacle, lots and lots of oozing, sweet treacle.\xa0After we were done I used my finger to lick the plate. We gave this a six\xa0out of five.', "The staff were extremely friendly, welcoming and conversational. They felt like great company. Sadly though, a lot of our food and drinks were delivered late, with some dishes actually sent to the table cold. This was very strange because we didn't go there on a busy night, so it can't have been that difficult to get this right.\xa0Unless delivering food to the table on 'Sri Lankan time' is\xa0a part of the service\xa0proposition here.", "The menu at Kaema Sutra\xa0is largely\xa0blanded down to better accomodate palettes not too fond of spice, and\xa0might be for you\xa0if you're not a hardcore spice fanatic and want to appreciate the texture and flavor of Sri Lankan food without the orgasmic quantities of spices it usually comes drowned in.", "Given,\xa0the dearth in options for gourmet Sri Lankan eats in the city, suited for varying palettes, I'd say it's still a good option if you're new to town, want to try some relatively authentic Sri Lankan fare, and have the disposable income to match.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Given,\xa0the dearth in options for gourmet Sri Lankan eats in the city, this is a good option if you're new to town, want to try some relatively authentic Sri Lankan fare, and have the disposable income to match.\xa0\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Fancy Lankan food for fancy folk\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Kaema Sutra serves good, modernized Sri Lanka fare at a bit of a premium price.

Those with stingy wallets can go to Pillawoos to have their Rs.20 hopper (and have an indigestion the next day). Kaema Sutra lived up to the hype of what I expected somewhat authentic Sri Lankan cuisine at a fine dining restaurant. And our bill amounted to around Rs.11,000 for 7 people and we ate like refined pigs :) But this place only deserves 3-Stars.

Not many options for vegetarians - and only two options for desserts. Spoke to one of their staff - and he said its the menu by Dharshan and they are not allowed to change a bit and also accepted food is not spicy enough even for them.

But however even this niche Market should think twice before spending because an Egg Hopper with 2 Eggs will cost maximum of 28 Rupees (I know since I do own a small restaurant myself). And the rest (172 Rupees per Hopper) would be the price you pay for the Place + Profit. Definitely should ask ourselves whether it is Worth-it to pay that amount per hopper.

The cost came to Rs 1300 per head including all taxes, which is in the range of what one would expect to pay for a dine-out experience at a nice restaurant in Colombo today. Whether or not one wants to pay that for Sri Lankan food is a personal value judgement.

The no-carb, no-guilt Kottu is simply fantastic. The egg white base substitutes so perfectly for the rotti that you don\'t even miss it . Kudos to the Chef for this contemporary twist on an all-time-favourite Sri Lankan dish. Another interesting version of an almost  \'Sri Lankan Caesar salad\' in the chicken curry salad which is a favourite of those I dined with. Again, it\'s a meal in itself and high-proten at that. As for the much-talked about roast chicken - it was so moist and flavoursome. And not deep-fried and unhealthy like most of the regular "Sri Lankan roast chickens". We liked it so much that we got it as a take-away thereafter; was so well-presented in its own bag/box (Perfect for when you\'re entertaining guests and you want to pass it off as your own creation!lol) ', "\r\nOn to more excellent dishes we've had there - the beef pickle is just insanely divine! We can't get enough of it. It's even a great accompaniment with drinks at the Kaema Sutra bar adjoining the restaurant. I must also commend the quality of the lunu miris which tastes so fresh and complements the hoppers perfectly. The hoppers are huge and glorious. The two-egg hopper is too good to resist. The seer fish curry and prawn curry are also favourites. Fresh, perfectly cut (the fish), huge (the prawns) and delicious. I must confess that I can't comment on the desserts as we've never made it that far, having over-indulged on the main course.

Remember, that is a great place to taste Sri Lankan food for foreigners. (Considering the amount of money they have to spend for such an experience in a country like this) But, I really doubt about these Sri Lankans who go there and appreciate their food for that money.

I have instructed our waiters not to serve prawn or crab curry in the future in order to prevent spillage.', '\r\n', '\r\nThank you sir for your thoughtful and considerate response. I have a few thoughts:', '\r\n', '\r\n1. I too am bamboozled by the journey of the worm in question, jettisoned like a bullet from the rafters with such force that we had to cut into the prawn to find it.', '\r\n2. I am equally flummoxed by the fact that the worm seemed long dead. I have three theories here: Either it died during preparation (likely), died from its suicidal leap (perhaps), or died in the curry tsunami of 45 minutes prior (probably not). Either way, if a worm finds its way on to my plate, it is a problem. This does not seem to have been acknowledged with appropriate modesty.', '\r\n3. I am saddened that I will now have to serve prawn and crab curry for myself. Perhaps even sadder about the fact that your best solution to this spillage problem is to stop serving your guests altogether.', '\r\n', '\r\nLook, the basic point is this. One day we will all be food for worms but, for the time being, I would rather not have you speed up that process by giving me worms for food. That said, mistakes are made and are easily forgiven. More relevant here is the response to a series of unfortunate events, from the in-house management to the very top of the food chain. Instances such as these should be handled with humility and propriety. Not responding appropriately is also a response, and you are equally responsible for what you do not do. I expected better and certainly expect better in the future.', '\r\n', '\r\nTill then, I will look on the bright side. Finding a worm when I bite into a prawn is twice as good as finding only half a worm.', '\r\n', '\r\n<iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="//imgur.com/a/djw7K/embed"></iframe>\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Have been out to Kaema Suthra a few time and have had very nice and interesting Sri Lankan food for a fair price.
