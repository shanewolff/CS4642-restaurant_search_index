Thank you for the positive mentions of the view of the Colombo skyline and of the colonial heritage building. Whilst we appreciate your honest feedback, few points need to be highlighted from our end. We are currently undergoing renovations to our Governor’s restaurant kitchen, hence the limited menu options we will be offering a full menu starting November 2014. The comments on the food and service times are taken as constructive, and improvement areas are duly noted and taken up at daily briefings to improve service and food quality, to ensure the best overall dining experience.', '\r\n', '\r\nBest Regards,', '\r\nBazeer Cassim', '\r\nGroup General Manager – Mount Lavinia Hotel Group\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have had some very good buffets this past month but this was the tastiest by far. I have no complaints. Buffets have not been making me go " wow" lately. But it was Indian night and everything tasted great. When I saw all the meat curries, the salad bar  could not compete. The mutton ,pork and eggplant curries were the stars The deserts were excellent. The chocolate mousse and creme caramel were wonderful.

No bones, but it had only pieces of fat. No meat whatsoever. ', '\n', '\nLooks like they don\'t pay attention to the "quality". ', '\n', '\nMargarita cocktail was too limey.
