name: Cafe Bagatalle
excerpt: A great place for some healthy meals.
yamu_review: ["For every 5 new restaurants, there's one healthy spot opening up in Colombo. Cafe Bagatalle's got a range of intercontinental cuisine with a Sri Lankan twist. The food was\xa0absolutely delicious and\xa0vegetarian-friendly.", "Their menu is pretty extensive and they've mentioned all the nutrients below each dish which is cool if you're counting calories.", "We got a Brochette of Mozzarella (Rs. 490) which had 395 calories. It was accompanied by a saffron risotto and grilled vegetables. The risotto was delicious and cheesy which blended very well with the vegetables. The veggies\xa0were fresh and seasoned\xa0properly. The portion was really filling, but I don't think you can call anything healthy after putting\xa0that much cheese in it. However, texture and flavour wise it was top notch.\xa0", "We also tried the Penne with Roasted Prawns (Rs. 725) which was 120 calories. It was absolute heaven. The pasta was cooked well and the pesto and chilli oil were a great combo which gave the pasta the spice we Sri Lankans can't live without. There were about 6 or 7 big prawns which are a lot more than you would normally get in a pasta dish at that price. The portion was enough for one and wasn't as filling as the risotto. \xa0", "For dessert, we got the Hot Brownie and Vanilla Ice Cream with Crunchy Nuts (Rs. 300). It was worth every penny. What's more, it was made with gluten free kurakkan. Of course, it didn't taste like your normal\xa0chocolate brownies, but that doesn't mean it was bad. \xa0It was gooey and a lot less sweet which was great because the sweetness of the ice cream balanced out the flavours.\xa0", 'For our drinks, we got a Cafe Latte (Rs. 400) and a Signature Coffee (Rs. 450). The Latte was served warm and the espresso used definitely came across as a bit bitter. The signature coffee was sadly just an iced coffee, although the waiter did tell us that\xa0before we ordered. It was your normal iced coffee, sweet and tasty, so why\xa0they would charge Rs. 450 for it is beyond me.\xa0', "The staff was friendly and accommodating. There was no problem with our orders and the place wasn't that crowded when we went so the food arrived fairly quickly.\xa0", 'The interior of the cafe is small and cosy with wooden tables and chairs and a lot of natural light. The cafe is\xa0surrounded by a lot of greenery and they also have a great fitness theme going on where you can sit on stability balls or spinners while you enjoy your meal, which is kinda cool.', 'It might not be as healthy as ', ", but it's got good food, relatively mid-range prices, and a super central location on Duplication Road! They also deliver now, so call them to find out more.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Cafe Bagatalle's got a range of intercontinental cuisine with a Sri Lankan twist.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හොඳ කෑම වේලක් කාලා බීලා, එක්සයිස් පාරක් එහෙම දාන්න ඕනේ නම්, කැෆේ බගතලේ එකේ තියෙනවා එක්සයිස් මැෂින් කීපයකුත්.\n                                                                                                                            ']
user_reviews: ['\n                                            Dropped in yesterday. Just scouted a bit inside Hameedias and entered. A nice, cosy charming place. Probably the cheapest three course meal ever in Colombo! For Rs999 combo per person you get to choose a salad, a soup and a main. I was quite flabbergasted with the price and the options you could choose as if you do order the above individually the prices are different and certainly total ads more than Rs 999, i wonder if its a costing error or a promotion ?? However lovely salad, a nice creamy soup and delicious pasta!. You can view the open kitchen and the two chefs were busy going about the operation and everything was served within the a reasonable gap. ', '\r\n', '\r\nCafe bagatelle is a gem! With eating quality food is costing a fortune with those taxes and service charges added, this is one hell of a steal!\n                                    ', '\n                                            Love this Cafe.
