excerpt: Panino makes excellent sandwiches. Filled with tasty ingredients, grilled, prepared with love. If you visit the Good Market each Thursday they're well worth a try. Otherwise they're a good choice for catering or office lunches.

These sandwiches are fantastic!  The Cuban is really popular with my colleagues, and I love the Heart Health Veg and the Chicken/Sun-dried Tomato.  So good!  For the kids, you can order a peanut butter and jelly panini or Nutella and banana.

Panino puts a lot of effort into sustainable sourcing.  They use fresh, all-natural bread from a local bakery, local cheese, and as many organic ingredients as possible.  They take their motto "Act Global, Eat Local" pretty seriously.  It might add a bit to the price, but we think the end result is worth every rupee.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Wanna taste this soon \\m/\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Regarding Jan's comment, it is sad when someone devalues a product simply because it is local and not imported. It appears we still havent learnt to celebrate our own stuff. Panino should be applauded for taking the uniquely Sri Lankan Roast Paan, a common everyday item, and turning it into a gourmet sandwich. I also agree with Amanda that the quality and value of the sandwich is in the quality of the fillings. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Re Jen's comment above about Roast Paan, it is sad to see people devaluing something simply because it is local. Panino should be applauded for taking the uniquely Sri Lankan Roast Paan, a common everyday bread, and transforming it into a gourmet sandwich. What an original idea! There are sandwiches sold in Colombo made with Focacias or Baquettes that aren't half as good. I agree with Amanda, that the value of Paninos stuff is in the quality of the fillings and the great crusty bread. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I thought the 400/- to 550/- price range was quite high myself, but having tried to eat one alone, and having watched the guy pteparing it, I have to admit its got a ton of filling and is v large.

Better value for money than many other gourmet sandwiches around.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I Think there Sandwiches are excellent, but yet overpriced, I was having high tea with my friend's at Cinnamon Grand recently, and they offered these sandwiches, which would be the same as Panino's, with a variety of Sushi and other delicacies, all for a mere 1500. Considering an 5 Star Hotel offers the same indulgence, and other buffet items, 400-500 for a Sandwich seems Extreme, it's definitely going to be a one time or once a month outing, but please consider lowering your prices, in UK I had an Similar Sandwich and it only cost 2 quid, if you do price it competitively maybe the market can grow a lot more better and in terms of value for money.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Regarding the above comments, Jen did not put down anything local. She simply said that it seemed like a lot to pay considering that roast paan can be purchased elsewhere so cheaply. I prefer many Sri Lankan food items to imported ones, but it would be crazy for me to pay the same price for SL seer fish that I pay for imported Norwegian smoked salmon. Another thing: while I am happy to see that foreigners are working to make the slogan 'locally sourced' to become fashionable in SL, many things here have always been grown or produced right here and there was no marketing catchphrase for it. We just bought roast paan and Highland cheese, and didn't think twice. Still, the Good Market seems to have avoided the pretentiousness and self-righteousness that plagues many other makeshift sustainable markets around the world, and anyone that highlights the great produce of Mother Lanka gets an 'A' in my book.

I think it is DEFINITELY value for money, if you compare to the other sandwich outlets, such as Sandwich Factory or Paan Paan. These are not your every day Fab tuna/egg/chicken sandwiches. These create a wholesome meal in itself.
