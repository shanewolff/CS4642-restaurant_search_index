name: Candy Planet
excerpt: For candy enthusiasts, Candy Planet in Battaramulla is the holy grail - not only is it affordable but you will find every imaginable type of candy there. It is probably as close as we Sri Lankans will ever get to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

Nothing is worth having diabetes. One in five adults has either diabetes or pre-diabetes and one-third of those with diabetes are undiagnosed in Sri Lanka. This has startling implications for the spread of the disease here.', "\r\nDiabetes can adversely affect almost every organ in your body - from your brain cells to your liver. Responsible for a staggering number of amputations, diabetes has also been known to lead to impaired vision and heart attacks. It's a frightening disease, made even more so by the fact that its incidence in Sri Lanka seems to be increasing. Please be more responsible in your advertising.", '\r\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    @maya - It's only a review and someone felt about going to the shop.

Get over yourself! Yamu\'s a food blog. Reviewing a store selling candy and putting a journalistic spin on it does not necessarily mean that they acted irresponsibly / or promoted the spread of diabetes in Sri Lanka; for as mentioned above, nobody reading that statement you highlighted is going to take it seriously in this context.

However, the candy I bought from Yum Yum (sour belts and strawberry shaped gummies for 260/100g) tasted cheap and didn\'t have bright colours like Haribo candy product…\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Waiting to come there\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Actually yum yum has a more refined collection at a cheaper price.

Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the world. It makes people suffer like being in hell. People with diabetes can go blind due to their illness. They then have to walk about using a walker. A diabetes sufferer can have their extremities amputated due to their illness. I have heard of people who have had their toes, or part of their leg, or their foot amputated due to this dreadful disease. Insulin dependent diabetics are dependent on their family members or care givers to give them their "JAB" every day. People whose family members are afraid to do this, are dependent on medical personnel like nurses to do so! (every day!) They feel faint when they don\'t eat at a particular time. As I said, a slight wound can turn into a nightmare of hospitalizations, monitoring and losing of life or limb!', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Adiabeteser and Esh. you are crazy !\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Awesome!!!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Do you have to pay cash or credit?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Candy planet sweets can we sell my city as authorised under your company?pls details.\n                                            ']
