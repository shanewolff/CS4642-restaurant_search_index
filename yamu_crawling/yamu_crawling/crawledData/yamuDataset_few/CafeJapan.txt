name: Cafe Japan
excerpt: Cafe Japan is a small home restaurant off Marine Drive in Colpetty that does some pretty great Japanese cuisine. It's the definition of a hidden gem since the place is ridiculously hard to find. They've been around since 2000, but those who know about the place seem to want to keep it to themselves.
yamu_review: ["Cafe Japan is a small\xa0Japanese restaurant that's run out of someone's house. It's a pretty quiant set up and that's where it gets its charm. One of Colombo's best kept secrets, it can be a little difficult to find.\xa0We dropped in for lunch.", "Most menu items are priced above Rs 1500, so you have to order wisely. You can't really go wrong with the sushi platter. We went with the assorted sushi (Rs 2000). The sushi is pretty generous. We got 8 pieces. They always seem to get the balance of wasabi just right, so you get a nice kick. It comes with some miso soup and pickled vegetables.", "For Rs 2000, you can choose two dishes from the available options. We tried the Yakiniku Pork and Karage Chicken. The portion is enough for one, and it's altogether quite filling. I'd choose Karage over any other fried chicken, any day, and Cafe Japan's rendition is what made me fall in love with this dish in the first place. The chicken is moist while crispy on the outside with just the right savouriness. The pork was alright, but it tasted mostly of soy sauce. This also comes with miso soup and pickled vegetables.", "They have actually hired a local waiter, and we were glad to see that she has been trained very well. She knew the menu and was very prompt. In the past, we've been served by either the mother and daughter of the duo who run the place.", "The ambiance is very homely, and there's plenty of natural light.\xa0They've got a formidable library of manga, which is super cool. I don't read Japanese, though, so that's a shame.\xa0", "Cafe Japan is a great place to drop in to for a casual date. It's got a cosy, homely vibe that you won't find at any other Japanese restaurant. The prices aren't necessarily better than the other options, but the food is still pretty good. Dinner can get expensive, though, as it's a set menu, so do call and inquire if you're interested as they charge upwards of Rs 5000 per person.\xa0", '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Cafe Japan is a great place to drop in to for a casual date.

I was completely disappointed by the  way we were treated by the lady who runs the restaurant. To start with, the waitress that was serving us was sweet but she doesn't speak English and could not answer our questions, so she called the Madame. The madame was very impatient and not ready to explain what's in the menu and left us in the middle of the conversation asking my friend to explain to me, because she does not have time!!! It was completely shocking to be treated in such a manner. When we decided to leave, she was not even apologetic. I am still trying to figure out what is the reason for such bad treatment. The only explanations I can find is that either place is meant for Japanese only as the other customers were Japanese and were treated with all respect or she was not happy with having a woman with head scarf in her restaurant. In spite of the high recommendations I got for the place, I will never set a foot there again.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I ordered some food from Cafe Japan after reading this review and thought it only fitting to write about my experience.

", '\r\n', "\r\nBut let's get to the female proprietor! God she was rude! ", '\r\n1. She asked/told me to call back once I have actually decided what I want; because I hesitated for a split-second! (Which I ended up doing out of mere shock!)', '\r\n2. Called back, and got reprimanded for deciding to get 2 dishes instead of 1!', '\r\n3. Felt like a big burden throughout the conversation as she sounded so annoyed and impatient!', '\r\n4. And finally, when I asked what my bill totalled to, I was told to calculate it myself!!! Goodbye!', '\r\n', '\r\nAll round ridiculousness. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    oh wow.

I called in at 11 am and was told that I could come at noon. When I went there I didn\'t even get a simple greeting, she immediately launched into a tirade that she was very busy, this was a bad time (even though the restaurant was empty) that they mostly do delivery. She then handed me a menu and disappeared back into the kitchen leaving me alone for a solid 15 minutes in the deserted restaurant, flabbergasted!  When she re-emerged, she was rude and impatient about the questions I had of the menu as if I was imposing on her time. I concluded that this behaviour post-meeting may have had to do with a "Japanese only" or "foreigners only" type mentality, since there was no reason why she could not have politely informed me beforehand over the phone that there were no dine-in opportunities that day.  That said, I found the atmosphere of the restaurant clean and charming in a homely Japanese sort of way. The website/blog is also informative, though seems geared more to foreigners. None of this makes up for my most un-Japanese encounter with the proprietress, and I will never go back there again.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have been trying to call them since 6 in the evening and there is no answer !!! :(', '\r\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I've been going to Cafe Japan ever since it opened on duplication road which has now been replaced with a furniture shop, and the owner (Yomoko) has always been kind and cheerful, her english is not fantastic but she basically runs the place by herself which means she's always busy!

address: 7, 10th Lane (off Marine Drive), Kollupitiya 
directions: Brace yourself. The easiest way to get here is from Marine Drive. If you're heading north, it's past Majestic City, past Hotel Sun Hill and past Schofield Place. This is where it gets confusing. It's the fourth road after Schofield Place and the second road named 10th Lane. Yeah. If you're coming the other way (south) it's four streets past Lower Bagatalle. From Galle Road, turn down Schofield Place and then turn right.
