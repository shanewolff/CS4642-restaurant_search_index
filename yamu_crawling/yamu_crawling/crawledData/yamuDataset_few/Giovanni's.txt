excerpt: Giovanni's is a little Italian pizza place run by a chef who uses his own recipes, and serves fresh from a clay oven. 
yamu_review: ["Since they first opened their doors one\xa0year ago, Giovanni’s has been our go-to spot for wood-fired pizzas. This time around, despite\xa0Dimuthu’s absence on the day we visited, they still dished out the quality pies we've come to expect from them.\xa0", 'In the course of the last 12 months, the folks at YAMU have made numerous stops at Giovanni’s. I happened to be one of the only people in the office to not have tried their pizzas, so I was excited to see if all the hype was for real.', 'On our previous visits, it had been Dimuthu manning the clay oven, so we were a bit surprised to find a different gent working the dough this time around. From what I’ve heard, Dimuthu trusts very few people with making pizzas,\xa0so I was definitely curious to see how well the chef deemed worthy of the task\xa0would fare.', "Giovanni's keeps things relatively simple with a 20-item menu\xa0that revolves around classic italian preparations. You'll find the entire menu written out on a blackboard at the entrance.\xa0Prices range from\xa0the mid-to-high end, but the pizzas are large and\xa0more than sufficient for one hungry person. They also top their pizzas more generously than any other pizzeria in\xa0Colombo (even compared with the likes of ", ' and ', '), so the value for money is unbeatable.', 'Since the option was available, we went for two half-and-half pizzas. The first of these had\xa0bacon and pollo cacciatore (Rs. 1,400 and\xa0Rs. 1,500 respectively\xa0for full pizzas). While the latter is essentially chicken doused in a tomato sauce with added herbs,\xa0the bacon pizza is\xa0quite simply that — unadulterated bacony goodness with warm, stringy mozzarella. There wasn’t much else going on in the bacon half, which really helped emphasize\xa0the fatty flavour of the meat.', 'One thing we really appreciate about Giovanni’s is the fact that they absolutely pile on the toppings.\xa0One slice of the pollo cacciatore\xa0had the equivalent of half the topping you’d get at a mainstream pizza chain. The chicken, while well-cooked, was also moist.\xa0The flavour of the tomato came\xa0through well, further complemented by the basil leaves added on top.', '\n\xa0', '\nThe other pizza consisted of one salami half and the other half, all-meat (Rs. 1,700 for a full pizza\xa0of either). With a fermented tang that comes through in the flavour of the pizza, salami may not be for everyone.\xa0The pizza nails the brief in terms of flavour, but it may taste funny to those who aren’t too familiar with the distinct flavour of salami.\xa0', 'The all-meat was also legit, with plenty of bacon, chicken and beef, topped off with sliced capsicum and basil leaves. This also had a spicy kick\xa0to it, with a bit of dried chilli added into the mix. Despite the abundance of ingredients, they still managed to maintain that balance of flavours, so the savouriness and spice is evened out by the creaminess of the mozzarella.', 'Despite its obvious popularity, Giovanni’s remains quite a small space. The ground floor is where the magic happens, while\xa0the compact\xa0dining area with just a few tables occupies\xa0the first floor. It’s actually quite charming—and perfect for a date—despite the simple wooden furniture, chequered table cloth and balconies that overlook the street.\xa0They’ve got seating for around 15 upstairs, but don’t be surprised if you see them set up tables on the side walk to accommodate the hungry hordes.', 'Clay oven pizzas require very little cooking time, so you can expect the service to be quite fast. That being said, it is still quite a small operation, so the service time does get\xa0slower as the place packs up. The guys at Giovanni’s are casual, friendly and knowledgeable. As for the new chef, we’d say he fared pretty darn well.', "We’re happy to see that Giovanni’s hasn't let the demand affect the quality of their pizzas. It’s one of the few places in town that has been consistently knocking it out of the park, so we’re excited to see what Dimuthu & Co. come up with next.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Since they first opened their doors a year ago, Giovanni’s has been our go-to spot for wood-fired pizzas.
