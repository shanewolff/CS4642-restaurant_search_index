excerpt: Chinese Juchunyuan in Colpetty is one of the few places in town to try out Chinese hotpot. The catch, however, is that if you don't add the right ingredients to the hotpot you'll basically end up drinking broth. On the flipside, it can also be excellent should you make it right.

The catch, however, is that if you don't add the right\ningredients, you'll basically end up drinking broth. On the flipside, it can\nalso be excellent should you make it right.", "When we first tried out the hotpot at Juchunyuan about a year back, we\nkinda' hated it, but that was partly due to our inexperience when it came to\nhotpots. The food here is definitely an acquired taste and any local planning\non dining here should be willing to try something very much different from the\nfood we generally get at other Chinese eateries. They do offer fried rice and\nside dishes but everyone seems to come here for the hotpot. Prices are quite\naffordable with the hotpot easily enough for four people.", "They have a whole bunch of different options when it comes to choosing your\nsoup, which can be a bit confusing for those (like me) who aren't very familiar\nwith the procedure. After some deliberation, we decided to go with the half\nchicken soup (Rs. 600) with fish balls (Rs. 366). In retrospect, we should\nprobably have gone for a different soup since the boiled chicken in the one we\ngot, was all but tasteless.", 'One thing to note though, is the fact that\nthese fish balls were not actually balls of fish meat, rather something they\nimport which has an interestingly fishy flavour and an almost gelatinous\ntexture.', "Along with the soup they bring you a few\ningredients - chopped cilantro, chili tofu, chili paste, soy sauce, chopped\ngarlic and an interesting peanut sauce. This is actually where all the flavour\nof your hotpot comes from. The waiter will make a sort of paste using all the\ningredients, but then he'll bounce and leave you\nguessing.", "After playing around a bit we found that\nadding said paste to the hotpot really makes a world of difference when it\ncomes to the flavour. We did so judiciously since we didn't want the flavours\nto be overpowering. Once we hit a good balance, we were left with quite a tasty\nsoup with a bit of heat from the chillies, cilantro aroma and saltiness from\nthe soy sauce. We added the paste to the steamed rice, and even that tasted\ngood.", 'Just to cover all the bases, we went ahead\nand got the pork and mushroom casserole (Rs. 646) which tasted pretty\ngood with a slightly thick gravy and very flavoursome black mushrooms,\nalthough it could have had less veges and more pork.', "Juchunyuan is pretty much the definition of ghetto Chinese. The ground floor\ndining room bares a striking resemblance to a washroom, complete with bathroom\ntiles. What's great though is that everyone that dines here seems to embrace\nthe ambience. So yeah, this certainly would not qualify as fancy. They've also\ngot a tiny ancient TV in there as well, playing black and white Sinhalese\nfilms, which creates a very apparent mismatch between the clientele and\nentertainment.", "They've got one local waiter, who was friendly though with a very limited\nattention span. Besides that the food was prepared quite fast, so we didn't\nfind ourselves getting angsty.", "Chinese Juchunyuan is not for everyone, and there's a good chance that their\nhotpot may not appease local palates. However, if you're really looking to try\nsomething new, this may be just the place you're looking for.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Chinese Juchunyuan in Colpetty is one of the few places in town to try out Chinese hotpot.

That is far from what Indie and shru did. To be honest, you can't 'play safe' for food review. Viewers will get bored as they already predict the same result for every review.

The Sri Lankan staffs aren't friendly but the Chinese staffs are nice. The hot pot is my favorite. I always order bean curd skin, pork meat, Chinese cabbage, black mushroom, prawn wanton, and at the last, add noodles in the pot and eat it like ramen!

', '\r\n', "\r\nThe gist of it all boils down to broth you pick and the sauces they give you. I usually order the spicy broth as it has just the right amount of spice and flavor (it might be on the 3.5/5 on a spicy scale). As for the sauces, you need to be a little creative about how you mix them up. I recommend adding a generous portion of the peanut sauce and augmenting it with the other sauces/ingredients to suit your taste. The restaurant also has a variety of meats, vegetables and mushrooms to add to your hotpot, and don't be afraid to try out some unconventional ones!", '\r\n', "\r\nThe Chinese staff is quite nice as opposed to the Lankan staff who seem rather 'meh'. Anyway, the prices are affordable and anyone with a somewhat voracious appetite can eat for about 1500/-. ", '\r\n', "\r\nTip: Go with friends. It's actually more fun than a regular dinner. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Place has been significantly upgraded since this review with a very nice interior, all AC and purpose built fancy granite too chafing tables! Food was fantastic the meat was very good, the broth was as spicy and flavorful as what you get in China, the noodles were bit too thick, Sea Weed was fresh and nice, so was the black mushrooms and portions were well sized. It is bit high priced but worth it when you fancy the real deal. Ah one caveat, the bill is handwritten Chinese!!! So if you ate a lot and lost track its a tough chat with the half English speaking Chinese staff yo understand the bill, it’ll be a good idea to get a POS with English and Chinese prints … probably not essential as the clientele seems 99.9% homesick expats anyway!\n                                            ']
