yamu_review: ["Who doesn't love a good cupcake? We tried Scrumptious, a\xa0home baker\xa0not to be confused with ", '. A strong positive is that delivery is free - so call a couple of days ahead and make your booking!\xa0', 'Although they specialise in wedding cakes,we just tried their cupcakes.\xa0We ordered a set of twenty five cupcakes for an office party. One was the chocolate cupcake and the other one was red velvet,\xa0at Rs 140 each.', 'We grabbed the chocolate ones first. They were really good. In comparison with other chocolate\xa0cupcakes in general where they spike the cuppies with too much essence or too much sugar, this one balanced it out perfectly. The crown of chocolate frosting on top of the cake complemented the perfectly baked cake base. It was moist, soft and had strong notes of chocolate.', 'The red velvet on the other hand was your average cupcake. Although the red velvet base on itself was good, the frosting had a very mild taste of cream cheese which we felt\xa0could have been better. The bright red hue on the cake was beautiful though.', 'There were also these quirky,\xa0pouty, lip shaped sprinkles\xa0on the red velvets which were\xa0kinky.\xa0However, accidentally sending cupcakes with lip shaped sprinkles and\xa0maraschino cherries to\xa0your boss as a gift or your business partners wouldnt be too ideal. Just saying!. These would be perfect for valentines.', 'Upon speaking to the home baker, we were told that she bakes basically anything, from pastas to wedding cakes. Her pricing also depends on what you may require and of course, the quantity. As of now they do not have a menu but they are also willing to handle any dessert that you may ask for.', "Even though we tried only two flavours, both cupcakes ticked all the boxes of a good, satisfying cupcake. \xa0For Rs 140 per\xa0piece, we enjoyed it! Our cupcakes did arrive two hours late though, so be a little wary if you're working on a party schedule."]
