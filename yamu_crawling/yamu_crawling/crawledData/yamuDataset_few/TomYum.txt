name: Tom Yum
excerpt: Tom Yum specializes in Thai street food. We think it's some of the best Thai around.
yamu_review: ["Tom Yum is one of the go-to places for authentic Thai food. They're also great at whipping their namesake, the Tom Yum soup which we featured in one of our ", ". We hadn't reviewed them for a couple of years though, so we dropped in a few days ago to see what's new and what's not.", 'What used to be a two-storied building\xa0has reduced\xa0into just the bottom floor now, as', " occupies the first floor. The furnishing is minimal and neat, with rather uncomfortably clunky chairs that makes maneouvering your seat quite impossible. That aside, the rest of the table settings are quite nice with fresh flowers to spruce things up.\xa0 The restaurant is run by a husband and wife duo, and the kitchen staff are Thai, so you know you're getting legit Thai food at the very least.\xa0", 'Service was pretty efficient even though it was a one-man show with the husband taking care of orders and the tables. Nothing to complain there.', "There's a small selection of soups, fried rice, and meats to choose from, including an interesting array of desserts. The prices are quite expensive though, with a single portion\xa0for meat alone\xa0closing in on a thousand rupees. We went for a Chicken Thai Fried Rice (Rs. 700) and Sticky Rice (Rs. 350), and picked a portion of Grilled Beef with Thai Sauce (Rs. 850) and Garlic Chicken (Rs. 750) to go with both. The rice portions are\xa0", '\xa0enough for one person, while the accompaniments are sufficient for 2 or 3 people, a size I found weird in case someone wanted to dine solo.', 'As far as taste and flavours go, we were satisfied; the fried rice had crispy bits of chicken in it and was nicely made, the sticky rice quite... sticky. Perfect to practice eating with chopsticks, if there were chopsticks.', "The Garlic Chicken was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside: it did seem lightly tossed in oil, but it wasn't overdone. The beef on the other hand, looked great in the menu's photo, but what we received looked completely different. It didn't have a marinade, and was more like fried bits of chopped up beef. What shone through all these were the dippings which accompanied the meats: intensely flavoursome and quite overpowering in chilli and acidity, they were amazing.", "The beef came with a lemon and chillie dip, and the chicken with chilli in vinegar; we basically doused the beef in it to disguise the meat's blandness.\xa0", 'Oh, we also had a Spicy Beef soup (Rs. 950) which we liked — it looked a bit like gravy but had a lot of lemongrass and spices going on, and helped clear our sinuses. The soup itself was great but the beef in it was mediocre; most of it was gristle, so that was disappointing.', "We finished off with a creamy Coconut Ice Cream and a Thai Iced Milk Tea. The former was reminiscent of Samaposha (according to Dili). Garnished with cashew nuts, it's a refreshing dessert albeit an expensive one at Rs. 500. Presented in a green mason mug, our Thai milk tea (Rs. 500 too) looked murky but tasted just about alright.", "It's a generous portion, but was slightly watered down and not as flavoursome as the one at ", 'for example.', "With added taxes, our total was just over Rs. 5000. The food was nice, but doesn't give you value for money in either portion size or quality; and 5000 bucks for two people (without getting separate appetisers, drinks, or desserts) is quite a lot.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Expensive Thai food.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Tom Yum specializes in Thai street food.

The staff were really nice and the food was the best Thai I've had outside of Thailand.

As soon as I was given the explanation, I tried the soup. Never in my life have I taste anything like it. I have been back almost daily for my lunch and keep trying the different dishes. The Red Curry, with steamed rice with a fried egg placed on the rice has been so far my favourite. The Green curry with steamed rice was great and the squid garlic curry with steamed rice was great too accompanied with thai ice tea.

The popular positive review is that the food is tasty. One must remember that when you walk into TOM YUM, it is not a fast food outlet. Your food is cooked in a clean kitchen and  served in a few minutes by the owners themselves, because they care for their clientele. Street food vendors in Thailand cook the food in  your presence , on the street, but this cannot be done here. Instead, you are seated and the kitchen is in full view.', '\r\nIf one is in a rush and needs to have the food served immediately, then one has the choice of eating in fast food outlets. The other point is the owners do not add service charges. If the calculator is brought to the table, that shows the honesty displayed. You will not be over-charged for your food. Another point is that some want quantity. In that case, one is free to order an extra dish or two or if it is more rice one wants, order an extra bowl of steamed rice. The owners genuinely are doing their best to serve street food to their clientele as best as they can, as it is done in Thailand. The food is tasty, the owners are friendly, the place is clean, what more would you want. Come one, come all and enjoy this unique style of cuisine like none other. My very best wishes to Divanka and his lovely wife and limited staff to continue to serve up such delicious street food.', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have been to Thailand more than a dozen times. Reading both the owner and other comments… Plus look at the photos…I think for a Thai street food concept, Rp 525 is expensive for such small portion of fried rice. We passed by this place and the place is so small with no ambience. We went to Siam House instead, even add together the service charge and taxes, we enjoyed our meal and big portion. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Went there with my wife but to our disappointment it was closed yesterday (24/11/2014) and no notice about it. They have no website or facebook to get notifications. Then we went to Siam house as its clolseby plus wanted to have Thai last night but our experience was average.

I had always been skeptical of eating Thai food outside of Thailand, because my very first Thai food experience was at a night market in Chiang Mai, and since then any Thai food cooked by Non Thais was like duh! but this place, I fell in love with hence seeing three thai chefs working in an open kitchen, you could watch them cook! and practice a bit of my rugged Thai! I had Yum Woon sen (Glass noodle soup) it was delicious, fresh, vibrant, and intensly spicy! it was like a breath of Freshness! and I was back in the streets of Chiang Mai!  the only issue is that the portion size especially the Salad i ordered was a tad small, could have been a tad bigger ! I will defintley go back ! and I hope to see Nam Prik and Nam Prik Plah on the menu soon !!!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Went there again, i like Thai and wanted to make sure our first ghastly impressions were wrong.

Aroi Maaaaak!! if you're looking for authentic thai food in Lanka, this is the place! everything is broought in from Thailand! that makes the difference! and yes portion sizes are small, but that's how any Thai would eat back in Thailand. It is about savouring the food and not just gobbling it! and the ice lemon tea was amazing too! don't miss the best thai food in town! It was like taking trip back to Chiang mai all over again!

I don't think so, perhaps you shouldn't add too much Nam Plah (Fish sauce) while you eat!!!! There is also talk of this place not being exactly thai street food, well if one needs that then the only way is to hop on a plane to Thailand! And i don't think that all types of streetfood will sell here in Colombo! if you had been to Thailand and eaten at people's homes, and the streets at night markets! then you will understand the whole concept! Eat Thai food like a Thai ! not like a Sri Lankan eh ! Cheers, Kop kun Kaap \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Swaadee Kaap! I went to Tom Yum tonight for dinner (7th Dec 2014), first of all for the lovely food, and that ever smiling hospitality! and also to check if some of the comments saying that services get slow when it is late or crowded, you know just find out, because I don't want people to think that I am supporting the restaurant blindly, but the friendliness and smiles and greetings were as warm and inviting as any time of the day, the service was fast, the food was super super delicious ! Arrrrrooooooiiii maaaaakk! and it was busy with both take away and dine in customers! and I have always had two wonderful hosts in Div and Rom! and you know something, I didn't have any MSG in my Rad na (seafood noodle soup) :P :P and I had to pay for my dinner no freebies!! this is a restaurant, I didn't visit Div and Rom's home!

Their concept is awesome. They have positioned themselves as a street food joint - which doesn't stop only at their menu. Even their operations are somewhat similar to that of a Thai street food outlet. They buy only what is necessary for that day, and bring down most of their spices from Thailand. Their entire culture revolves around street food; even the billing of the customer is done in that manner! ", "\nI am happy to have stumbled upon Tom Yum. It's time Sri Lanka opens its eyes to street food culture as a whole.

Firstly thier prices for a 'street food' place were exorbitant. Rd.425 for 4 teeny squares of prawns toast?! And our 'prawn' pad thai which cost more than Rs.600 had just two medium sized prawns over a pretty small portion of noodles. And the taste factor was below par too. I'd rather go to Siam House and eat regular Thai food at the same price, but with a better ambience and professional service.

I understand that it's a family run business and they'd like to keep it under control but some investment in hiring an experienced manager would go a long way in improving service.
