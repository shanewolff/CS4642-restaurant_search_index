", '\r\n', "\r\nAnd the review doesn't do the place justice. 'Not the hidden gem it used to be' - OK, it may not be hidden but it's still a gem. It's owned by a Sri Lankan guy and his Swiss wife. The point is that she is an expert restaurateur (restaurateuse?) and the staff know how to take ownership, which is not always the case in Sri Lanka. The reason it isn't always top on TripAdvisor is that people object to the delay at busy times. This is due to the size of the kitchen and the fact that everything, except the vegetables, is cooked from scratch. It might be an idea to introduce daily specials, but it's because the menu doesn't change and, to be honest, is not too taxing on the cook, that everything is utterly reliable. One of my gripes, as an expat, about Sri Lankan restaurants is that quality control is often lacking. That is not the case here. ", '\r\n', "\r\nTip: they recently introduced a trimmed down lunch menu but, if you know what's on the evening menu, you can still order from it at lunch. They won't show you the evening menu at lunchtime. \n                                            "]

directions: From the main (Galle-Matara) road pass the tea-pot and SLT signs and turn right down the Beach Access Road (Dewale). Continue past Happy Banana to where the road forks and go left. Kingfisher is down there, past Hot Rocks. If you go past there's a small parking lot.
