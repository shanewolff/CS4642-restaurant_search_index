excerpt: Sugar Rush is another home-baker who makes some very nice fudgey brownies, and a great creamy lemon cake. 
yamu_review: ['Sugar Rush is another new\xa0', ', and they make some really awesome fudgey brownies. We tried a bunch of their Valentines special brownies (heart-shaped ones), their brownie-cupcakes, and their lemon cake.\xa0', 'I loved the little heart shaped brownies. These were much easier to digest - they were softer, crumbly, with a middle cream layer, and they make adorable finger food at a party. These are good brownies, though Rs. 120 each, which is a lot considering the size.\xa0', "Sugar Rush right now seems to have its main focus on brownies and cupcakes, but we were glad to find they've also started doing a lemon cake. It's amaze, and deserves a 4/5 rating all on its own. There aren't a lot of people who make good lemon cake - lemon is an underrated flavour for some reason. This cake, for only Rs. 1000, is easily enough for about a dozen people: it's layers of cake, with lemon cream between, and a whole bucketload of it slathered on the top. The cake was wonderfully soft and the flavour, especially the after-taste, is awesome - but it's strong so this is probably only if you're into this flavour.\xa0", "The Sugar Rush minimum order is 6 pieces, and they were around Rs. 120 each. So you'll probably spend about Rs. 1500 for a set of twelve - the usual rate for home baked food these days.\xa0", 'Sugar Rush is a good choice if you want brownies (also check out ', ', ', '\xa0and ', " for great brownies). Also if you're ", ', these guys do some of the best.\xa0']
