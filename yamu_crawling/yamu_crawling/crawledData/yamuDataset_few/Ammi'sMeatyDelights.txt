You'll need to order either a day in advance, or place the order early in order to have it delivered the same day. You can find their menu ", ', but the rates are a bit outdated so expect to pay around Rs. 50 more. ', 'While the delivery is convenient and generally reliable, the process of making the order was painstaking in our case since the guy on the phone knew very little about the menu or their existence.', "True to the home cook code, Ammi's Meaty Delights offer great value for money and some tasty Sri Lankan style meat dishes. Classic home cooked meat curries delivered to your doorstep."]
