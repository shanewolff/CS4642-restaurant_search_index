When we saw the tiny boxes come out we were ultra disappointed.', '\n', '\nIndian Hut you should go back to India!', '\n', '\nIf you want honestly made good tasting quality food thats at a decent price try the small shop at the end of pedlars around the corner - forget the name but great kothus and other bite items there.
