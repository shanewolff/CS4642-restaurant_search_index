name: E-Cafe
excerpt: E-Cafe has a nineties - early 2000s vibe going on, burgers, desserts, coffee, drinks, and bready stuff. All of them pretty good.
yamu_review: ["E Cafe doesn't give off the best impression from the outside. We honestly thought it was an internet cafe or PC store - and we've never been happier to be\xa0proven\xa0wrong.\xa0As far as meals go, they just have two burger options at present, but there's also\xa0a nice selection of cakes, breads, cookies, and drinks on offer instead.", "There's a 90's and early 2000's theme/vibe going on with the music — cue Westlife, old Rihanna albums, and the like. If you're a 90's kid who's unashamed of liking boy bands and all that, you'\xa0love this place.\xa0You'd also enjoy it if you love books, because they've stocked a couple of shelves up on both floors with a few.\xa0", "The gray chairs are incredibly comfortable despite their austere appearance, and Bhagya described sitting in them as a 'hug for your back'. Adding a bit of colour to this gray-and-pine coloured set-up are the patchwork chairs, which I think are hella cute.", "What's rather surprising about this place is the amount of\xa0", ". There are four rooms, two of them quite private, and a balcony upstairs. It's a great place for a party or a hang-out sesh with a close group of friends.", "It's an even better place to work in because with that much space around, you can grab yourself a quiet corner and settle yourself in with your laptop (we noticed plenty of\xa0plugpoints around, near all the chairs).", "The staff are nice and friendly, they've also got some clear plastic shields over their faces when handling food, so that's pretty neat. Service isn't slow, they take just about five or ten minutes to get your food to the table.", 'All their food seems to be handmade, including buns and patties, which is interesting.\xa0', "The prices are on the high end, with their Prawn Burger being Rs. 980. However, even the patty is homemade, and is actually made of whole prawns. It's rolled and patted down in a dough which holds it together, but the prawns break off easily. The bun is also fresh, nicely toasted, and well presented.\xa0", 'The cherry on top was the salad, which was dressed beautifully and was superbly flavoured. The greens\xa0used in it were fresh, with thin ribbons of green apples thrown in with red lettuce for colour and flavour.', "Their Oreo Cake (Rs. 400) was intensely moist, light and fluffy. Best thing for us was that it wasn't overly sweet at all, and doesn't make you OD on sugar or chocolate. As far as the flavour goes, it's quite subtle but definitely there. We also loved the frosting, which was un-sweet, rich, and creamy.", "Meanwhile, a Strawberry Smoothie is Rs 470, but it's HUGE. A lot like a yoghurt drink, this is a bucketload of yoghurt and fresh strawberries blended in well together. This can knock\xa0you out if you try to finish within half an hour.", 'Their coffees are also a bit on the pricier side, with a cold drip at around one grand. Ouch. We settled for a Hazelnut Latte (Rs. 530), which was beautifully flavoured but somewhat lacking in the caffeine department.', "This was also a rather large cup, so it'll last you quite a while if you don't mind it being lukewarm.", "They haven't gotten many choices for selection up on the menu, but they said they'll be expanding it soon. The burger choices at the time of this review were teriyaki chicken\xa0and prawn, so if you're vegetarian you'll have to\xa0stick to the cakes and bready goodies.\xa0", '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Good place to grab a book, some coffee, or settle down with your laptop.

I was excited that they actually have parking space; but it's small so a bit tight to park even though only one of four or five spots were taken.  Anyway, after maneuvering my car in and walking in and the security guard asked me to move my car 'cos it wan't in between the lines - now, don't get me wrong, i'm usually a stickler for correct parking - but the lines (rope) was barely visible under the mud and the place was not at all busy - I would have obliged; but I was irked that he didn't help out or suggest that while I was parking and decided to tell me to move only after I was inside the shop  after all that effort.  He said, if I was leaving quickly then it's fine - so I said: fine. I'll just get take away.

While I was pleasantly surprised by the interior, I was annoyed that this simple order took a whole 20 minutes - despite the ONLY order they had!  There were literally two other people in there, both of whom were busy doing their own thing and had already had their food.  So after my long wait for my simple take away I come back with very expensive packaging; very crappy food; and literally nothing else.  I requested plastic utensils since they didn\'t put any in the bag and i\'m  not particularly thrilled to eat a salad with dressing by hand back at my desk or anywhere!  - but NO, they only have metal silverware!  So I have the only thing that looks halfway decent (albeit tiny) in a plastic container but no way to eat it!! So I proceed with the fries:  No condiments. No ketchup. No salt.  No pepper. Just deep fried potato (!!!!).  I did get some paper napkins - after I requested for them, of course.  And I\'m not even going to start with that "oil infused piece of potato" (what they call a hash brown).', '\n', '\nI imagine/hope that baked goods are better.

We decided to leave has we weren't happy with he service and our bill almost reached 3000 which I was not happy about as the  service was rubbish.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    It's Horrible.
