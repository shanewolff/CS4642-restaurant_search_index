name: Achcharu Kadé
excerpt: The Achcharu Kadé is a popular stall that sells good quality, relatively upscale achcharu.
yamu_review: ['The Achcharu Kadé (formerly a pretty small operation) has expanded quite a bit and has stalls at a bunch of locations, including the ', ' but no longer the ', ". They're planning to open up an actual shop somewhere very soon but haven't disclosed the details yet.", '\n', '\n', '\n', "\nAlthough this is upscale achcharu at about Rs 150 a bowl, the flavour is authentic. No skimping on the spices or ingredients, and the nice tangy overtones are apparent. They've had stalls at fairs and avurudu celebrations and the like, so they're probably open to catering as well which would make a nice addition to a bigger sporting event.", '\n', "\nWe tried the two mango variants they had, which were both superbly spicy and decently tasty. There were about 10 varieties in all, and the stall is very popular so it makes sense that they keep quite a large quantity there. This also means that the vegetable/ fruit has time to properly marinate in the various spices. We hear their jambun achcharu is also pretty popular, but haven't tried it yet.", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\nThey apparently also sell a variety of local snacks which vary from week to week, but they were all out by the time we reached the Good Market.', '\n', '\nThe achcharu comes in convenient little plastic cups with spoons as opposed to the quintessential flimsy plastic bag sold on the roadside. Much better for the environment too if you get take away and re-use the little cups for leftovers or whatnot.']
