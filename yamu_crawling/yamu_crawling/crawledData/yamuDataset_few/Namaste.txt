Their Pudina Parattas were excellent, better than at most of the better known Indian restaurants in Colombo, and whilst the biriyani was more like a pilau, it was certainly very tasty. I think you should try this place again instead of condemning it out of hand.

That's why we have a comments section - to open up the space for a variety of opinions. I maintain, however, that dining at Namaste was very poor experience - so much so that (as a customer) I just wouldn't go back.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I quite like your guys' food photography.

Sadly, you are under stress by all three factors. Otherwise, you would not have certainly shown the kind of spirit displayed in your biased review, as well suggested by Lalith. Like the few others who have commented about your review, I am one of those who has visited Namaste four times already, both for lunch and dinner, three times with my family and friends, purely to give them a wonderful Biriyani feed plus other varieties of typical Indian stuff. A few of my friends had come a couple of times more, to carry takeaways of Biriyani for their colleagues. Such is the taste of the pudding. As one drop of rain water does not make an ocean, just one prejudiced comment will hardly harm the prestige, Namaste seems to have already earned in less than two months. Anyway, I hope Namaste management will take note of your review and be prepared to take up future challenges, of course those unbiased and well-intended. Joe and family \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Shru which curry house did you visit post party? Never seen a curry house open in the blighty after 11pm. Its always only a good old kebab place you can rely on, then again maybe your party was over very early.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    True Jayan…. Still racking my brains to think of good curry houses open after 11pm even in Southall, the bastion of Indian eating houses I'm hard pressed to think of any places open after 11! As for namaste visited it a few times and their dosai are second to none. Not tried the biriyani but highly recommend the dosai. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I have tried the Buriyani (Takeaway) at this place. The rice was not properly cocked (it was half cocked) and the Buriyani had lot of curry powder and Chile powder. I complained to the manager regarding this. I told the manager to try a Buriyani at Top Form or Big Bite at Nugegoda. My favorite lunch is Buriyani and I have gone to most of the hotels in Colombo and had Buriyani. I have been working many years in Saudi Arabia and know what a Buriyani is. I will never go to Namaste to buy Buriyani.

I have come several times with my family. Namaste special biriyani is best. their ckicken biriyani also very good. I have been India for so many times. Mr.Shru, Before criticsing their food pls understand morethan 20 kinds of Biriyani in India with defferent tastes. In Sri lanka also you get defferent type of biriyani. If you try 5 places for biriyani or any other food you will not get the same taste. I agree with you Amarawathi Biriyani is best for you. But for me Namaste is best. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I agree with Kamy. Namaste foods are very good I think mainly because their chefs are from india. Even though it took 30 to deliver my order their staff is very polite, specially person who handles the valley parking is very helpful. Namaste biriyani is original indian biriyani and not muslim biriyani like Top form or Big bite. I think they get their good taste they dont use artificial flavours like other places. their prices also resonable and their masala dosa price is little bit expensive. my advise is you should avoid Namaste rush hours mainly week ends. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Most of the prices are resonable cimparing with Amarawathi or Amrith.  I tried Naan with some curry. Not the best but very tasty. My advise, you should avoid rush hours. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    It beggars belief that we are supposed to read a review from a critic who can not even get the address of the establishment correct… basics my dear basics!!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    We tried the dosai/ naan and the tanduri paneer, the dosai was great, and the naan was a bit too dry. Tanduri paneer was good too. We had a problem with the service; very very slow. Nice people though. Never tried the Biriyani. I would say try the dosai menus.

We like your food and service. I cant understand why YAMU is criticising Namaste. Everyday we are passing Namaste and  we notice how your business is improving. (Eswahak ne Katawahak ne) Every evening lot of vehilces and lot of people are gathering to Namaste. As a Sri Lankan we are very happy to see that. Do not worry about the comments by SRUTHI. She is an Indian Prostitute who write anything for money. If you go through comments of other restaurants anybody can notice.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    a person who have tasted the real indian biriyani should comment of biriyani i guess…. most places in SL offers "SL Biriyani" which is not even close to real "Biriyani", poeple who knows about places like bawarchi in India would tell you the difference. But, compared to all other places, Namaste stands as number one…. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    We stopped at Namaste on our way back to Colombo after visiting the N'eliya.

Also, we were having Indian food after a long time so enjoyed every bit of it. we got the complimentary Chicken Pakoda and Fish Koliwada with red and green chutnies to start with, then the Butter Naan curry and biryani.

That being said, I've had the masala thosai and the ghee thosai with their sambhar and chutney combination, and both times, I rather enjoyed the meal. The sambhar and chutney weren't too spicy and the thosai was soft and crunchy. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Namaste is the best Indian restaurant in Colombo. Their service and foods are excellent. Today also I had my dinner with my family. I cant understand why people condemn Namaste foods. I think there is hidden agenda to tarnish the image of Namaste behind most of these reviews.  V is telling Namaste chief chef has left. Even today I met their chief Chef Suraj. Why these people mislead others. They sell Halal foods and lot of muslim familes like Namstr foods.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Farhan is correct. Still their Chief Chef is working. As a regular customer I also agree with Farhan. When we go through most of these reviews anybody can understand. Anyhow Namaste foods and service are good. They are the only restaurant who makes original Indian Biryani and Naans. Namaste prices are very reasonable. People who has not gone to the Amrith ,Mango tree or Maharaja Palace can say Namaste prices are high. As an Indian Living in Sri Lanka nearly 5 years all the way  I am coming from Colombo to Nugegoda mainly Namaste Price and quality. Also I have met so many Indians living in Sri Lanka foe years they really happy with Namaste foods. I recommend only North Indian food.

The appetizers were very good, especially the chicken pakora dish and the paneer pakora. My tandori boti kebab were delicious, but there were only 6 small ones. Would have liked one more to the order. I thought the butter naan bread should have had more butter but it was good. My mango lassi was great and would definitely recommend it.

I'll also be honest and say that I'm pleased that I did. I received a warm welcome and the staff were friendly. The menu was simple but well explained. After ordering, I was first brought a small starter, then well flavored pakora and accompaniments, things were looking good. The samosas to start with we're fresh and tasty.
