While they charge a premium for their bite-sized chocolates, we found very little we actually enjoyed, and wished\xa0we had gone for a bar of Snickers instead. (And as for their cheesecake,\xa0don’t even get us started.)\xa0', "We were actually quite impressed with\xa0the range of chocolates available at the store. All of it is priced between Rs. 100-180 per\xa0piece, which is to say that these are some of the most expensive chocolates available in the city. It went without saying that they\xa0had to be really good to make it a worthwhile purchase. As the subhead 'The Stuff We Didn't Mind' indicates,\xa0we weren’t really blown away by any of the 12 separate items we tried.", 'Of the eight chocolates, we enjoyed three: the blueberry, coffee-hazelnut and the peanut butter and jelly. Everyone at the office was unanimous that these worked primarily\xa0because of the fillings, and not so much because the chocolate element\xa0was exceptional.', 'If we had to choose, the PB & J was probably our “favourite”. We had no complaints about the\xa0filling, which had the classic flavour of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\xa0We also\xa0found the white chocolate-blueberry mix appealing,\xa0with a nice contrast between the milky sweetness\xa0of the chocolate and the tanginess\xa0of the blueberry. The coffee hazelnut was also quite\xa0accurate in terms of flavour, with the hazelnut coming through,\xa0followed by a milky coffee filling.', 'Their milk toffee (Rs. 480 for 200g) was pretty decent, though we really don’t see why anyone should paying that much for milk toffee when you could be getting it from the likes of ', '’s instead. This milk toffee wasn’t too sweet, which we didn’t mind. It was also speckled with a few chopped cashew pieces, but they had been added quite judiciously. The texture, however, could have been a lot softer and smoother. It wasn’t the kind of toffee that just melted in our mouths, which is what we were\xa0expecting at this price point.', 'The chocolate chip cookies (Rs. 220 for 100g) were passable, but a far cry from what home bakers such as ', 'and Brick Lane offer. The cookie could have been sweeter, with a slightly less crumbly texture. The chocolate chips that contributed welcome\xa0sweetness and a soft, melty texture, were the saving grace.\xa0', "Now that we're done with the stuff we didn't find offensive, we're left with everything else — some of which was\xa0barely edible.", 'Of the chocolates, the whiskey truffle was quite awful. The white chocolate coating was actually pleasant, but then we got to the filling that\xa0could only be described as tasting like detergent. The cappuccino (the one with the weird leopard print on\xa0it), was described as having a full-bodied shot of espresso, but did not have even a semblance of coffee flavour.', "I've tried several different desserts and chocolates that incorporate Baileys Irish Cream.\xa0For the most part, it's a tactic that works, since the liqueur itelf is quite sweet.\xa0I'm not quite sure how, but GMC managed to mess this one up as well. The more accurate description would have been Baileys Irish water, since the filling was just so diluted and lacking the\xa0beautiful creaminess of Baileys.", 'Hilda cookies are a type of shortbread\xa0cookie\xa0with a jam or marmalade filling in the centre. The shortbread cookie part was on point but the filling was just so confusing. It looked like strawberry jam (and was supposed to taste like it too), but the only thing we could taste\xa0was toothpaste. This may sound like an exaggeration, but we found ourselves just looking at it thinking, "What did we just eat?"', "We saved what we thought would be the best for last: the strawberry cheesecake (Rs. 450), since it was presented beautifully. Were we ever so\xa0wrong.\xa0This had to be the first time I've\xa0ever dumped a cheesecake after two bites.\xa0While the strawberry topping tasted\xa0pleasant, the cream cheese (or mascarpone?) was dense, the cookie base was more of a paste and the whipped cream had the texture of clay, as in we could mould it into different shapes.", "Here's a GIF\xa0of us messing around with the whipped cream. It tasted completely off, so we didn't really want to take a chance on an already terrible cheesecake.\xa0", "Well, there's 2,000 bucks we're not getting back. If a tiny chocolate square costs upwards of Rs. 100, it had better be excellent, or inoffensive, at the very least.\xa0If it was just one item that had missed the mark, we could have looked the other way, but you can't call yourself a 'chocolatier' and serve this up.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Gerard Mendis Chocolatier is a fancy chocolate manufacturer on Horton Place that also offers a range of other desserts.

When I asked for a proper box, I was given a cardboard box, complete with a coating of dust at 700 bucks. When asked how come, I was vaguely informed by the people behind the counter that that is just how things are done there. Like the review said, when you charge 100 - 180 bucks for a piece of chocolate and brand your chocolate as premium chocolates, the least you can do is to make sure that it is presented in a premium manner and that your staff is a bit more efficient and professional. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Poor Customer Service !! can be the best phrase to describe Gerard Mendis at present.
