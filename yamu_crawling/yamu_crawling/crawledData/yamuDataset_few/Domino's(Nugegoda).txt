We placed an order with the Hotline, it never arrived, we called the hotline again and they said, yes it will be free, and gave us the Wattala branch number to call. We called, they said they never received the order and that the call center cannot take orders, they should have patched the call to the branch. After which they started demanding we call the hotline to ask what went wrong, not offering anything as compensation. In this country the customer is always wrong. Seriously the manager Janake was practically shouting at my husband! After this we tried to call the hotline again, no answer. Also tried to post a consumer feedback on their website, and guess what, it doesn't accept it… Anyway they lost a customer…\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    recently ordered from them (can't remember the exact details).

So I figure the key is choosing the right toppings.", "\r\nI highlight recommend a medium pizza with the 'cheesy burst(?)' option, its Rs 400 more but its basically, dough, a layer of gooey cheese, dough, topping and cheese again. Its amazeballs. And if you order the Hawaiian, with extra jalapenos, the sour/citrusy topping sets off the goey cheese and its total pig-out heaven. Insanely messy but so good. The Keema is also awesome. Get the garlic bread with a regular pizza and it will suffice for two big appetites. ", "\r\nAlways take away. ALWAYS.
