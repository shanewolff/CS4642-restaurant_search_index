name: Monsoon
excerpt: Excellent South-East Asian cuisine in a beautiful and buzzing location.
yamu_review: ['Monsoon serves amazing South-East Asian food in a beautiful location at the end of Park Street Mews. You should go.', 'As a Sri Lankan I like punchy\xa0spices, a lot of flavor and rice or noodles. Hence, a top-class restaurant that serves Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean, Thai and Vietnamese\xa0fills a good niche here. People like those cuisines generally, and Monsoon does them very well.\xa0', "Let's start with the Hainese Chicken (Rs. 950). Despite its Chinese name, it's an immigrant dish, the national dish of Singapore.\xa0", "I'll just mention three ingredients.", 'Those are the basics of the dish and they were executed perfectly. The accompanying sides and sauces were just icing on the cake.', "Also, take this, the Crispy Hoisin BBQ Ribs (Rs. 1,300). Perhaps you can't see cause the fancy (and inept) soft focus, but there's a thick, sweet glaze covering the perfectly cooked meat. The meat flakes easily off the bone and, slathering it with the sauce, it's a perfectly balanced delight.\xa0", 'Ribs are normally hard to eat in polite company, but the pork here just falls off the bone with a touch of the fork. We ordered two.', "Also, Duck Salad (Rs. 750). Duck is popping up on menus all over Colombo, usually sweetened into oblivion. Here it is served charred and balanced with acidity from pomelo (fancy grapefruit) and given sweetness from roasted beetroot and sweet basil chili. Duck is such a rich meat that it can easily throw a preparation off balance, but done right it's mouth magic.", 'This is just a Rs. 300 side, but the long beans\xa0are also perfectly cooked in a rich and tart coconut milk sauce. This stuff is all hitting the sweet spot of my sub-continental palate.', 'As you can perhaps see, we ordered a lot of different things and shared. This is also a fun way to eat, no?\xa0', 'Here is the Pork Belly (Rs. 1,300), which just melts in your mouth, given form and crunchy by the fresh onions.', "Here also is the Beef Rendang, an Indonesian classic. I had a bad experience with some unrelated beef earlier that day and didn't really try this. My dinnermates said it was good.", 'This is the worst photo for one of the better dishes, my apologies. This is the Golden Fragrant Prawns (Rs 1,200). I seem to have got the basil in focus which is the least interesting part.\xa0', "Fragrant refers to smell, but smell and taste are intimately connected. The experience here is that you get the sweet softness of prawn immediately, then a late hit of smokey spice. I'm a sucker for food that changes in your mouth, and this is a good example.", "Normally in this section we just comment that the people were nice enough, but that doesn't really matter if you're hungry. The ", ' of good service is generally speed, and we were surprised at how fast dishes came out.\xa0', "At Monsoon, the dishes started coming out within 10-15 minutes from our order. They come out as they're made (not all at once) but that's part of the experience. It was nice to be able to try so many different things and not be stuck with whatever appetizer/main combo each person orders, with only a furtive nibble of something better. The experience is similar to ordering shared plates at ", '.', "The other thing is that our bill ended up being way less than expected. We paid about 2k per head, though two people didn't eat much. I'd say you can be happy with 3k each, which is a steal given Colombo restaurant prices these days.\xa0", "Note that they don't have a liquor license, so bring your own wine, or spirits or whatever you like. There's no corkage, or at least we weren't charged any.", "One thing I'll add is that pork, vegetarian and nuts are clearly marked on the menu. This is a life-saver for me (I have a peanut allergy) and great if you're trying to keep halal or vegetarian. Note that I don't know if everything is certified halal, but I think marking pork dishes is enough for most diners.", "Here is where my photos really fail you. I didn't even try to photograph the whole interior because the place was buzzing and I felt embarrassed standing up in the middle of it. Let me try and paint a picture with words.", "Park Street Mews is already one of the most beautiful locations in Colombo with exposed brick walls and large spaces, originally meant for horses I assume. Monsoon doesn't change their hall too dramatically, besides tiling one wall.\xa0Instead, the design goes vertical with plants hanging from the ceiling and some see-thru bookshelves.", 'The effect\xa0draws your perception up, making the space feel expansive.', "The rest of the effect is in the furniture - mixed marble for the tables - and comfy rattan for the chairs. There's also a bar in the middle and a couch in the center. Though the restaurant is packed you still have some distance from other diners, so you can have an honest conversation. The height of the space mixes all conversation into a pleasant buzz.", "Monsoon also has a key feature that many locations lack. People. When we went the place was full, and full of conversation, forming that low level human vibration that makes dining out exciting. There were people coming in and out, busy waiters, the place is alive. It's a good scene.", "Monsoon is great. It's competitive in quality with Colombo's fine dining restaurants, but it's quite unpretentious food. The inspiration is South-East Asian street food (which everybody loves), taken that extra 10% with plating and ambience.\xa0", "Park Street Mews is already the most buzzing, walkable place in Colombo\xa0and\xa0Monsoon is\xa0the ideal capstone. When you're there you feel like you're in the middle of a vibrant, cosmopolitan city, where you can have a nice meal and stumble out onto a street full of interesting places and people.", "The final thing is that it's not crazy expensive. So I don't know what to tell you. Just go."]

I was prepared for anything and we thought we'd swing by last evening. Provided we didnt like the place, we had a back up plan too. ", '\n', '\nBut quite to my surprise out experience at Monsoon was rather pleasant. From the ambiance to the music to the food to the service, I would give it 5 stars.

", '\n', "\nThe food didn't take too long to arrive and the service was good. ", '\n', "\nIf there is any complaint, it would be that the portion may be a bit small for an average person.

I had ordered the Koh Samui Crispy Fish dish, but the waiter had clearly forgotten to place the order for my meal or the kitchen forgot to make it (which he only realised much later when he came up to check on me when everyone else had gotten their food) so my food arrived late. I would have been fine with this, but he didn’t even apologise for his/the kitchen’s mistake. Then after my food arrived, it was so oily I could barely eat it. They obviously forgot my dish then prepared it in such a rush that they did a horrific job with it. There was still no apology from anyone, even after we made a complaint.  I am really disappointed with the food and shocked by their terrible customer service. Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.  \n                                    ', '\n                                            Lack of quality food. A lot of East Asian cuisines attempted in the menu but the restaurant doesn’t do justice to those dishes and it’s pretty disappointing. \n                                    ', '\n                                            Nice set-up and ambiance. But one goes to restaurants for for food, which in this case was mediocre to say the least. \n                                    ', '\n                                            Wow! This is probably the worst meal I had in a long time.  We had 4 different dishes and all 4 were equally terrible.  Food had hardly any taste. When we were dinning noticed another couple also complaining.  Spoke to the Chef and at first he looked like he was ready to fight us. On a positive note the ambiance was great so was the waite staff.  Prices were also horribly expensive for what it is.  Will never visit this place nor would I advice anyone to try the food here.\n                                    ', '\n                                            Wow!

Great ambience, great staff, great food. \n                                    ', '\n                                            It’s a converted warehouse and the designers have preserved that feel very well. The roof is high but with no columns and the cross beams chopped off it’s ability to hold up is questionable. ', '\n', '\nBaskets with fresh ferns have been hung from roof,  too high up to water. And naturally they have  withered and are almost dead already Monsoon is open only for dinner and reservations are essential on weekends as lots of people are still coming to see this new restaurant.', '\n', '\nMany things are good but the three basic essentials are wrong. The food is terrible, the prices are very high and the portions are small. Therefore the novelty will fade soon and no one will return unless they correct their act fast.', '\n', '\nFor example, one of the popular items on their menu, Beef Rendang, at Rs. 1,500+ per dish had none of the characteristic traditional flavours. It was tasteless with only a roasted cumin (local thunapaha) flavour and nothing else. Instead of the slow cooked solid texture, the beef had a mushy texture indicating quick cooking in a pressure cooker. And instead of a thick spicy gravy, it came barely tossed in a tasteless dip.  ', '\n', '\nThe much hyped Crispy BBQ ribs at Rs.1,600+ a portion was a disappointment even visually. The ribs were so small, it could have been the rib cage of a rabbit or even a chicken. It was not crispy at all and the little flaps of ribs were covered in a sickeningly sweet syrup. There was hardly any meat on it to eat. The ribs at Monsoon is a rip off compared to the solid racks of ribs served at the Shangri-La, TGIF and the Bavarian. At those restaurants , the price is much lower and the quality is streaks ahead.', '\n', '\nAnother much hyped dish, the Fragrant Prawns at Rs. Rs. 1,500+ per plate had only 5 small prawns. That’s the size of a starter at most Chinese restaurants in Colombo and its only half this price in those restaurents. Everything had fried curry leaves which is not at all SE Asian. ', '\n', '\nThe selection of mains on the menu is very limited. The portions are very small, not enough on their own as a meal and they all cost over Rs. 1,500/ - a plate as the restaurant adds a further 30% to the menu prices. ', '\n', '\nThe Desserts are Brownies, Sago pudding and sweet spring rolls. All of them failed to impress. They were obviously pre-made and had been around for awhile. All the food including desserts appear on your table super fast', '\n', "\nSome of the chairs are strap chairs. The straps have sagged and they are extremely uncomfortable. The cushioned seats on the wall too are uncomfortable.  The only comfortable chairs are the single chairs with cushions and they too aren't that comfortable. A nice toilet has been constructed way up on the wall, but everyone going in or out of it can be seen by everyone in the restaurant. ", '\n', '\nBottled water, tonic and soda are reasonably priced. They don’t have a licence to sell liquor. Therefore, they allow you to bring your own wine, spirits and even beer without charging any corkage.  Although they don’t sell any alcohol they provide high class service on that front: perfectly chilled white wine glasses, quality red wine glasses, slices of lemon for your gin, ice cubes for the drinks and ice buckets for the wine.', '\n', '\nIt is rather obvious that whites get special treatment at the Monsoon. The staff too seem to have been instructed to do so. Even the hostess who is very glum with locals s charming with whites and the Aussie floor supervisor and the Stewards too dance around their tables giving them a much better service than they do with locals.', '\n', '\nThere’s no band but there is very loud music that sets a lively mood. The best thing to do is to take your own drinks and go here for pre-dinner drinks. Have some starters here and move on to a better place for dinner.\n                                    ']

Apparently you might be wrong (http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/curry_leaves / ', ' )', '\n', '\nLooks like you had an extremely disappointing experience; you had a problem with the structure of the place, the plants, the food, the seating, the washroom location etc. The "much hyped dish, the Fragrant Prawns" starter you had, seem to not have impressed you too. Interestingly, you ended your review with "Have some starters here and move on…"', '\n', '\nWhy would you do that? Why would you suggest us to have such disappointing  starters at a disappointing venue and ruin our night from the beginning? ', '\n', '\nUnlike you I had a very good experience at Monsoon. I am surprised you called the food "terrible", especially given that there are quite a lot of positive reviews for the restaurant in other platforms as of now. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    @ Gayan P', '\n', '\nYou’re absolutely entitled to your own opinion. However, for the benefit of other readers, we’d like to correct the many inaccuracies, fabrications and exaggerations mentioned in your review. ', '\n', "\n1. We’ll start with your very first paragraph: “The roof is high but with no columns and the cross beams chopped off it's (sic) ability to hold up is questionable”. The building has been there for 50+ years without any changes to the columns or cross beams. Sorry you felt so unsafe in there, but your comment is unsupported by science, unlike our roof. ", '\n', '\n2. The “baskets with fresh ferns that have been hung from the roof, too high up to water” are actually watered everyday using a ladder and a watering can, before service. The plants are also replaced on a regular basis by a local gardening company. Admittedly, last week a couple of the plants were looking a little sad but they have now been replaced.', '\n', '\n3. The Beef Rendang is priced at Rs.1200 + taxes, not Rs. 1,500+ that you suggest. Also, it is not cooked in a pressure cooker (we don’t even have one). ', '\n', '\n4. Crispy BBQ Ribs are priced at Rs. 1300 + taxes, not Rs 1,600+ that you quote. You’ve mentioned that you seem to enjoy them better at other restaurants for a lower price. However, your recent reviews of those specific restaurants seem to completely contradict your comments.', '\n', '\n5. Fragrant Prawns are priced at Rs. 1,200 + taxes, not Rs. 1,500+. I’m not sure why you are comparing Monsoon to other Chinese restaurants in Colombo as we do not serve any Chinese food.', '\n', '\n6. If you Google, “curry leaves Southeast Asia” you’ll find plenty of articles that mention curry leaves as an essential ingredient to Southeast Asian cuisine. To save you time – “Curry leaves are used in Indian and Southeast Asian cuisine the same way bay leaves are used in the West” – BBC Food', '\n', '\n7. Adding a further 30% to menu prices is due to compulsory service charge and government taxes in Sri Lanka and unfortunately there is not much we can do about it. Given the number of restaurants you’ve reviewed, I’m sure you’re well aware of this.', '\n', '\n8. All of our desserts are made fresh each day and have been well received to date, we’re sorry you didn’t enjoy them. ', '\n', '\n9. The hand wash area of the (totally private) WCs is concealed from the restaurant with a curtain. On the particular day you visited, it had been removed to make an adjustment. It is now back up so will save your blushes whilst washing your hands in the future.', '\n', '\nWe are always looking to improve our offering and take all the feedback constructively. However, as shown above, we disagree with the vast majority of your comments. We believe we serve delicious food at very reasonable prices, and will continue to do so. ', '\n', '\nIn future, we would appreciate feedback at the time of your meal, rather than (or as well as) on social media after the event, so we can either change the dishes that you don’t like or ask our Malaysian Executive Chef to explain how the Beef Rendang is cooked or why he uses curry leaves. It should mean you enjoy your meal more, and it would certainly help us to improve your experience then and there, so we’d encourage you to let us know if you have any specific requirements if you do visit again.', '\n', '\nI will not respond to your comments on “whites are treated better than locals” as it is completely unwarranted and uncalled for. As you can see from all the other reviews on TripAdvisor so far, there is not one mention of this from any other Sri Lankan reviewer because it is simply not true. In fact, they all seem to be perfectly happy with the service provided. Your attempt to tar us with the racism brush is disingenuous and totally false.', '\n', '\nHave a nice day.', '\n', '\nBest regards,', '\nMonsoon Colombo\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Good things first - the design of the restaurant is lovely. Ambience was great. The presentation of food was also very well executed. But the dishes were very hit and miss. The pork belly is great - but 6(ish) slices of belly for 1300++ is definitely not the best value for money.', '\nCrunchy spring rolls were fresh but the filling was a little bland. Under seasoned.

Rendang is typically cooked for many hours to get very tender - in this case, the beef was slightly tough and underwhelming. Definitely not the rich, multi layered flavour you expect.
