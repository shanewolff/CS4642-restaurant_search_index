name: Big Bite Biryani
excerpt: The chicken was excellent, but it took them half an hour so we would have been pretty enraged if it wasn't. The actual biryani though, for us this is the rich saffron and meat infused rice, was disappointing.

Sure it's a little subtle, but this is superb quality rice and they know how to bbq chicken. Ask for a thigh/leg since the breast can be a little dry.
