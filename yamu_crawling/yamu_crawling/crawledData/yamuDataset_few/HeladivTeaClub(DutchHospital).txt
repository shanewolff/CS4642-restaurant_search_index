yamu_review: ['Heladiv Tea Club is a quiet, cool restaurant at the Dutch Hospital for sandwiches, waffles, a wide range of teas and even wine. You can check out our last review to read about their cocktails and wines, but this visit we tried out their mains.\xa0', 'Heladiv is like a tea lounge (much like ', ") with a little bit of a club vibe, with their dark leather seating, low lighting, electric green lights at the bar, especially in the evenings when it's more crowded. It's comfy and quiet in the daytime and is more suited to lounging around with a tea or milkshake more than dining in.\xa0", ' ', "It's located at the Dutch Hospital so it's a very pleasant location, right across from Ministry of Crab. Thankfully it's not that pricey - we spent only Rs. 2000 for two. Sandwiches and waffles are in the Rs. 350-500 range, and you get drinks for around Rs. 250.\xa0", "They have a few sweet waffles on the menu so we got one of our favourite combos - waffles with strawberries and cream. This was actually delicious, the waffles were of a nice thick, soft consistency, buttered with honey, and the strawberry slices were plenty and fresh - not the crisp, perfect waffles you'd expect at say, ", ", but still a good, sweet dish to try out. The Heladiv cakes are known for their high quality (though we didn't try them out on this visit) so that's worth a shot too.\xa0", 'We also got their smoked beef sandwich, which was simple but well put together with an assortment of fresh crunchy veggies and firm beef slices. The sandwich was a little tough to bite into owing to the beef, that would be the only criticism, regardless we kept going back for more of the flavours in this one.\xa0', "They make a lovely refreshing strawberry milkshake, although it's very, very sweet. I like ice cream in my milkshake so I enjoyed this frothy milky combo, although there was more of this flavour than actual blended strawberries so if you're someone who minds that you might find it tastes a little fake. These guys make an excellent Chai - a pot enough for two cups costs Rs. 250 - with that perfect blend of Indian spices and a little touch of mint, gives off a great aroma, and if you've had chai in India and liked it, this is a strong cup of nostalgia.", "Heladiv Tea Club is a nice, chilled out space to have some tasty food and drinks without spending too much. The food here is generally among the tastier ranges of Colombo's tea lounges. Some of the corners here by the windows are ideal for cosying up and reading a book. If you're at the Dutch Hospital and feel like an iced tea or quick snack, they're worth considering.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Heladiv Tea Club does a relatively affordable range of tasty waffles, sandwiches and teas at the Dutch Hospital.

The chocolate eclairs and the chocolate heaven are equally good… I try different options at Dutch for the main meal, but for desserts it was always Heladiv!!!

Good service, polite and punctual. The place is classy, cosmo was good, very neat and clean, free wifi, loved their choco bar, not a fan of cakes but coffee and sandwiches are my fav there not forgetting the salads. I have recommended this place to so many people and every one only had positive reviews about it. Nice place for wine and dine with a date, I have seen they treat all the people equal since lots of gays and straights are visiting that place for coffee meet ups. I say it has gotten an iT factor for an international place. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Had their Death by Chocolate which was superb.

Me and two of my lady friends ordered a pitcher of what was titled "Blue Margarita". What they brought us was a smaller than average jug which was not even 3/4s full. When we complained that it was not a full pitcher and that it had salt in the drink , they said all they could do is dilute it with more ice and that the salt was from the glasses. So after they diluted it with chipped ice, we sampled it with a clean  glass. The drink was too watery, AND salty. When we spoke to the manager, he was not only unhelpful but also rude. His explanation was that a pitcher was 6 glasses, and that they added blue curacao and therefor the quantity was less than a pitcher. Further, he flatly refused to accept that there was salt mixed in, asking us "How can you tell us what we mixed in the drink?" and also "You can\'t tell us how much a pitcher should hold!". So, after trying a few more sips (and realising it was not drinkable), we returned the barely drunk margarita and paid LKR.3,6xx/- and left. We got the name of the rude manager, but unfortunately I can only remember that it starts with "M". Just a heads up about being careful with your drinks selection, because if you aren\'t satisfied I\'m doubtful you\'ll be able to get any help.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Lunch here was great. Went for a salad. Well presented and with bags of flavour, the dressing was light and didn't overpower the dish.  Good selection of teas as you would expect from the name, including excellent iced varieties. Good service, although you can eat more cheaply in Colombo, this place is well worth a visit.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Lovely place!

We had a great experience at Heladiv this morning and was exactly what we were looking for: a relaxed place to have  a great cup of tea /coffee with some sweet options to eat, and a place which was in the Fort area and opened earlier than 10am. The staff accommodated our large group of 14 ladies and got all the orders served without a glitch. Super impressed! Thank you Yamu and Heladiv!\n                                            ']
