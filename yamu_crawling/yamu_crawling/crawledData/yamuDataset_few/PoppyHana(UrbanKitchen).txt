excerpt: Mid range conveyor belt sushi at Arpico's Urban Kitchen.
yamu_review: ["At risk to its own already overlooked sushi bar, Urban Kitchen has let Poppy Hana set up shop to provide conveyor-belt novelty based Japanese samplings to its primarily office lunch and Arpico shopping customer base. Put aside your Nihonbashi sized expectations if you have them, and you may be happily surprised by some hero dishes we uncovered. That said, as with our review of Poppy's Liberty Arcade branch, we do think there is room for improvement - particularly on the quality of their lower-end options and the number/variety of their conveyor options.", 'So just for a refresher, Poppy Hana sets itself apart in the local Japanese circuit through its ', ' or conveyor belt service option. The colours of plates on the conveyor reflect their price point. It also offers a la carte ordering. Here are the need to knows:', 'From the conveyor we started big with a Rs. 420 black plate featuring a middle of the road Salmon Mayo Uramaki Roll.', 'Given its standing as an imported fish black plate serving this was in fact just ', ' (so-so).\xa0The salmon was reassuringly fresh but overpowered by the mayonnaise. A bit more ', " (flying fish roe) wouldn't have gone amiss. Still, all would have been well if it hadn't been for the third piece of sushi being a poorly selected slicing of skin and tendon that was basically inedible.", 'Next up - a satisfactory Chicken Tempura and Prawn Tempura.\xa0These were well executed. The chicken was not too dry and the prawn not overdone, the batter crunchy but not oily.\xa0A decent effort all in all.', 'We also tried a solid Crab Mayo Avocado Uramaki Roll.', 'I’m not usually a fan of crabsticks but these were finely julienned and mixed generously with sushi mayonnaise for a creamy texture. With the rice, ', '(seaweed), and avocado, the dish hit the spot flavour wise.', 'Skip the uninspired Tempura Prawn (Chicken?) Futomaki Roll.\xa0Firstly, we were told that this was a prawn dish but upon closer inspection it turned out to be chicken. Even if we forgive this blunder, the roll was nothing note-worthu. The rolls were\xa0irregular in size and lacked texture or distinct flavour.', 'Finally,\xa0the disappointing Tuna Tempura.\xa0', 'Given its wish to be a part of a more accessible offering of Japanese food to the local market, it would be appreciated and also wise for Poppy Hana to pay more attention to the bottom end of their conveyor offerings. Additionally, we noticed that there was a lack vegetarian options on the belt (The menu has a few options though).', 'Menu Offerings:', 'Here were found the hero sushi (and one villain) via', 'a) An Accomplished Ebi Fry and Mayo Temaki Hand Roll:', 'I’m a big fan of the hand roll when having sushi, mainly because they’re usually huge and actually filling (I’m a growing lad). This was no exception. The fried prawn was crisp, fresh and hot. Instead of a tempura batter, this used panko breadcrumbs which were a world of difference to the mediocre tempura we had off the belt. \xa0A bit more prawn and a bit less rice and I would have been a happy customer on this one.', 'b) An Inspired Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll:', 'We then ordered a spicy tuna tempura roll on the recommendation of the waitress. The roll was hot with a light crispy tempura batter surrounding the rice. Points to Poppy Hana for their creativity, I hadn’t seen sushi like this in other sushi joints in Colombo. The tuna was flavourful, with a little bit of chilli kick and a sweet aftertaste that worked well with the silkiness of the avocado. This was clearly the best dish of the day and we would definitely recommend it.', 'To finish off, we tried the tuna sashimi. First impressions weren’t great; the knife skill was poor, with jagged edges and uneven slices. The tuna was stringy, and difficult to chew through, not that smooth texture that you get with a premium cut. Then the flavour, it just wasn’t…right, the aftertaste tasted almost artificial. And for 450 for 3 pieces we expected a lot more. This was the last dish of the meal and (literally) left a bad taste in our mouths.', 'Service was mostly good, the staff quickly brought over the menus. Food off the menu was brought out fast and staff generally attentive. The only fault we found was that some of the plates were dirty with a layer of grease, which let down a reasonably\xa0pleasant dining experience.', 'All in all Poppy Hana is a standard sushi joint, nothing special.\xa0It has some interesting dishes, but most are standard sushi fare. We would recommend ordering items fresh from the menu though.\xa0In terms of value for money, we think it’s slightly on the expensive side, considering its location and atmosphere, but not completely out of line with other sushi restaurants in town.', '\xa0']

user_comments: ["\n\n                                    I've visited Poppy Hana thrice. The first time a few months ago at Which Way West where the food, service and overall experience was excellent. The Chicken Ramen and Katsu Don was brilliant; with beautifully balanced flavours.", '\n', '\nThe second time was once again at Which Way West, but this time was a bit of a let-down. We ordered 4 dishes, out of which 3 were brilliant but the ramen which I ordered was terrible and definitely not the same as I had tried earlier. ', '\n', '\nBeing fond of ramen and having tasted it multiple times overseas and at other restaurants in Sri Lanka, I order it immediately when I see it on the menu. I specifically ordered it with no chili, hence ordered the regular chicken ramen. When I got it, however, it was loaded with chilli and I got no other flavour because of the heat overpowering the dish. And when I pointed this out to the waiter, he had the audacity to reply with "Sir the ramen is usually spicy". Being a chef myself and also being extremely fond of the dish, I know for a fact that the ramen is not "usually spicy" unless specifically made so.', '\n', '\nThe recent experience was on 15th May ‘16 at Poppy Hana in Urban Kitchen. The overall experience was just terrible!!! ', '\n', "\nWe ordered a Chicken Ramen, a Gyu Don and a Mabo Don. Let me start with the ramen. Once again, same story as before!! We ordered regular ramen and specifically mention no chili and yet the broth is spicy enough to burn one's throat. The only explanation I can think of is that the chef adds chili or a heap of pepper in the preparation of the stock. But to add insult to injury, besides the heat of the chili, the cloudy broth was void of ANY flavour whatsoever.", '\n', '\nThe Mabo Don and Gyu Don was slightly better but not by much. The flavours in the dishes would be a 5 or perhaps a generous 6/10. Presentation would get a 0/10. First impression of both dishes were appalling and had no eye-appeal to it at all.', '\n', '\nBut the slap in the face for the night was the miso soup. The miso-flavoured liquid with a few strands of seaweed and tofu – because calling that a miso soup is an insult to the actual dish – was lukewarm. So naturally we sent it back to be reheated. A few seconds later the beeping of a microwave could be heard and sure enough, it’s back on the table, slightly warmer. Yes…Poppy Hana serves microwaved ‘miso-soup’!!!', '\n', '\nI’m not going to even begin on the stale sushi on the belt. I would have understood if the above happened if was a busy night and a full house. I would even excuse bad service or anything else as long as the food was great. But when it’s an empty restaurant and the chef has only 4 covers (our table), as a paying customer I or anyone else for that matter, would not settle for any excuse for the food that was served to our table.', '\n', '\nIt is a sad and disappointing impression which I am left with for Poppy Hana. Especially since the first time I really enjoyed it and this was highly recommended by so many people. I really hope this is taken constructively to improve the quality of the food. ', '\n', '\nNeedless to say, my family and I have been left with a bitter taste in our mouths for the food and will not be returning or recommending the restaurant to anyone, anytime soon.', '\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have been going to this place for the last 2 months.
