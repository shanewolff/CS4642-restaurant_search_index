Its great that you can also make this at your home, just buy a pack of fresh strawberries and a bottle of syrup from Jagro, then go for a stirred yogurt can and corn flakes pack from food city. There, you have your breakfast berries meal.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The Waffle and cheese cake is simply awesome. Recently I tried the Breakfast Berries and the tarts, that was also simply awesome. I have been to both, however I think that the service is much better here. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Tried the Waffle one and it was delicious!
