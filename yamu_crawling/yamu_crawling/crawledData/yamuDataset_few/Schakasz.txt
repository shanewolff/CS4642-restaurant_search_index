excerpt: Schakasz is a little cafe in Kirulapone exclusively for desserts. They've got everything from creme brulee to chocolate ganache cake, in large portions. 
yamu_review: ['Schakasz opened up last year as one of Colombo’s only dedicated dessert bars. They had a\xa0pretty good start, and\xa0one year down the line\xa0they’ve really come into their own as\xa0one of our favourite dessert spots in Colombo.', 'For the longest time Colombo didn’t have many dedicated dessert spots other than the ice cream parlours. Things have changed for the better in the past few years with the surge of home bakers and the Good Market graduates, with some of our favourites like ', ', ', ' and ', ' all opening their own spaces. Though relatively new compared to the others, Schakasz has really stepped up their game over the course of the last year. Their menu tends to change a bit regularly, though they have do have mainstays like the crème brûlée and the chocolate madness. Their prices are on the mid to high end with most dishes falling between Rs. 300 - Rs. 500, but their portions are generous, so it’s totally worth it.', 'We started with their Hot Chocolate (Rs. 430), which is probably one of the richest and most chocolatey you’ll come across in the city. Yes, Rs. 430 is pricey but this is one ginormous mug, easily enough for two. We liked the fact that this wasn’t very sweet\xa0since it’s meant to be had with a dessert. The marshmallows were also a welcome addition, complementing the thickness of the hot chocolate.', 'Schakasz’s Crème Brûlée Cheesecake (Rs. 450) is probably my favourite dessert in Colombo right now. I’ve had this on five separate occasions and it has been on point each time. This combines the best of both the dishes with a crunchy biscuit base, rich custard and cream cheese centre, topped with burnt caramel and frozen raspberries. The reason this dish works so well is because of the perfect contrast between textures, temperatures and flavours.', 'You get a light crunch from the burnt caramel, followed by the smoothness of the cream cheese custard center and finally the texture and ever so subtle savouriness of the biscuit base. The frozen raspberries may seem like a small addition but they\xa0do\xa0wonders by adding a burst of acidity and freshness along with a coolness right before the warm burnt caramel.', 'Their Kahlua cheesecake (Rs. 450) was recommended to us by a bunch of people and it delivered. This is basically a classic cheesecake with a generous layer of Kahlua mousse on top. We appreciated the fact that the Kahlua wasn’t overstated here.', 'That being said, this is still adequately boozy, with the cream cheese layer balancing it out well. We’ve also had their no-bake cheesecake which is also great, making Schakasz one of Colombo’s best spots for cheesecake.', 'Their strawberry panna cotta jar (Rs. 380) is also a solid choice. You can’t really judge the consistency of the panna cotta until you really get in there, but we found it to be just right with that little wobble we always look for. The layer of strawberry coulis is a bit tough to reach, but it had a nice tartness which offset the rich panna cotta well.', 'The only thing we weren’t too crazy about was the Chocolate Fudge Cake (Rs. 450) which was a bit on the dry side. This actually wasn’t bad but it kinda fell short compared to the others. This had a layer of cake, followed by cream and a fudge base. The problem was that both the cake and the base were quite dry. The cream helped a bit but we think it could have been a bit sweeter to offset the heavy chocolate flavour.', 'The look and feel of Schakasz has remained mostly unchanged during the past year. Located on Stratford Avenue, it’s easy to spot with white walls and quirky window doodles. It’s still mostly a take-out kind of spot, but they do have two tables set up inside with seating for around ten, and a few tables set up outside as well.', 'For a small dessert bar, Schakasz actually has quite a few people working behind the counter, but that’s partly because they do all the baking on location. The folks there were welcoming and really friendly, which is all we can really ask since there isn’t much else in terms of service to consider here.', 'Schakasz has become one of our go-to spots for a sweet fix with their innovative and consistently excellent dishes. If you’re craving a great cheesecake, you’ll want to stay here for a while.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    One year down the line, Schakasz  has really come into their own, and is one of our favourite dessert spots in Colombo.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Schakasz is a little cafe in Kirulapone exclusively for desserts.

Reasonable prices and sizes that aren't too tiny to leave you hungry or too big to overwhelm you. The Chocolicious and Creme Brulee were divine. Decor and the feel of the space are so wonderful - the attention to detail is brilliant and you feel so at home there. In addition, the owner's such a sweetheart and having new desserts being made right in front on your eyes is ever so tempting.

I am always in the look out for creme brûlée and hadn't found any place who  perfected it yet. So with all the great reviews I had high expectations . The burnt sugar crust was don't very well and cracked through like it's supposed to, and then I tasted a mouthful of it. It was runny-not rich and creamy as it should be and a little sour. Yes. Sour. I did not enjoy is sadly. I really wanted to like it. But it was not very good.(Plus it came in a small pie dish (I think) as opposed to a small ramekin with a little bit more Depth like I had always had.) sorry but I'll try it again sometime\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Brilliant food, I would rate this over barista \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The food is good, but the branding is beyond horrible.', '\n', '\nI spent a good 30 minutes last evening googling (on my phone, while on the move) for these people, and trying to find a location or phone number, and eventually gave up and got a cake from somewhere else.
