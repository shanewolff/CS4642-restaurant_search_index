excerpt: This little buth kade on Sri Saranankkara Road in Dehiwala is a hidden gem. It doesn't really have a signboard and seats only a cramped eight people, but the family running it serves up consistently tasty rice and curry.

address: Sri Saranankkara Mawatha, Dehiwala 
directions: It's between Bhathiya Mawatha and Hathbodiya Mawatha, on the east side. There's a road that leads to the Sri Anjaneyar temple on the west site, the kade is kinda opposite that.
