name: Grand Beijing
excerpt: Grand Beijing is another Chinese place around the Kollpity junction that serves up good, authentic dishes at affordable prices. 
yamu_review: ["Grand Beijing Chinese Restaurant is one of the good ones if you're looking for authentic Chinese food in Colombo, but a bit more affordable than places like ", ". The place is run by Chinese management and cooks, even their hotline is answered with a 'Nin hao' - but there are Sri Lankan waiters around to keep you from getting lost in translation.\xa0", "As a starter we got these prawn balls which we didn't expect much out of (Rs. 668). Basically big spheres of mashed prawn, batter fried, and they tasted pretty awesome, especially with the lettuce and chilli sauce that came with it.", "We also got a plate of vegetarian dumplings, stuffed with fresh leeks and spicy onion. As someone who doesn't usually drool over veggies, I have to say this is a very tasty dish and a total win if you've got a vegetarian in your group. Also not too pricey with more than 12 in ours, enough for two, at Rs. 968.\xa0", 'Our seafood fried rice barely had seafood in it (microscopic prawns and a stingy amount of cuttlefish), but the rice was still tasty, not too oily, and came in an awesomely large portion enough for 3, at Rs. 528. We loved our plate of stir fried beef tenderloin with plenty of green chillies (so much that we saved some for later too) - soft beef bathed in chillies and sauce, a treat for people who love spicy food (this was enough for 2 again, at Rs. 618). \xa0', "The restaurant is nice - just a big open, clean space, wooden furniture and a few chandeliers. Service is basic, with just waiters taking your order and the dishes arriving in about 10-15 minutes. You might see some of the Chinese managers and cooks around but they don't seem very chatty.", "Grand Beijing is a good choice if you're looking for some authentic, appetizing Chinese food, in a pleasant environment, without spending a whole lot (Rs. 1000 for one person). Take a group with you since the 'small' plates of dumplings and rice especially are actually big and the cost can be split.\xa0"]

Waiter kept forgetting to bring our water and tea after reminding them 4 times. Chinese guy at the reception was an a**ole. Food not good at all. Limited food items available and no pork :(.

So happy to see they have a great selection of authentic dishes.  Food was good but definitely over priced as the chicken dish hardly had any chicken and was full of bell peppers.  Ordered  a mutton stew dish which was about 2000 but pieces were all bones.  no meat.  Hope they look into this and dont try to rip of customers as would like to go there again to try more dishes.   The st daff were all sri lankan who dont really know the dishes and the owner is a chinese who doesn't speak english.  so communication is a problem as is the case with all these new chinese restaurants opening everywhere in Colombo.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I wouldn\'t recommend this place. It started out well, but had a horrible experience the second time around. Service was not good. Took ages to get served and there were only 2 dining groups in the place. Food too was not up to par, most of our dining party had bad "after effects". Cleanliness was abominable-even before getting into the place. Garbage was left out at the front of the place. In hindsight we should have just taken that as a sign and left asap.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Extremely disappointing. The crispy Peking duck was served cold with a warm sauce over it. We had one mouthful and left the rest.  Returned the dish and it was brought back still cold! The other dishes were equally disappointing; deep fried prawns (these were OK although batter was very thick), prawns with cashew nuts was ok, the vegetable rice was perfectly cooked but  laced with chives (not my choice). Best of all was the mango milk shake.  Would I go here again for 6,900 Sri Lanka rupees. And I would have been upset if I had paid half that. Asked not to be charged for the returned uneaten duck but that was refused… First time in many years of travel that I felt obliged to report my experience.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Tip for all Sri Lankans and expats looking for authentic Chinese food.  As of now (August 2016), all the Chinese and Taiwanese families I know who live in Colombo choose Grand Beijing for combination of authenticity and good price value, along with decent owners and waiters.  That's the simple truth. We have tried most of the authentic Chinese options. Grand Beijing is where we go to spend our own money.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Horrible food and horrible service!!
