yamu_review: ['Cinnamon Hotels usually come with around two or three restaurants, most of which are priced in the higher end of the spectrum. Cinnamon Red, however, has just the one restaurant on their 8th floor named Flavoured, which manages to offer a decent selection while also being affordable. They serve a buffet for dinner but we tried their ', 'The passion fruit panna cotta ']
