excerpt: Yaal Restaurant down Marine Drive still serves some very tasty and not-too-pricey food, and their crab curry is still good - though it's their biriyani that blew us away.

I want to be brutal with my comment as I was disappointed. Due to time constrains, and the parking and traffic mess took away the dinner. No customers at all around 6- that I can understand. The portion was very small. Chicken curry portion was given in a container a little bigger than the yoghurt tub. And the worst part was that the curry was it had a burnt taste. Probably some careless cooking. What owners of these restaurants should is that the customers are spending their money and time and it is a lot of effort to think where you want to get your food. And you walk into a restaurant, and you get some food. The owners just chuck on your face some food- they decide the quantity and quality. Come on Malaysian chain Marry Brown. You are bold enough to enter the Jaffna food genre- you think you can survive with this attitude? \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    How about the cleanliness?', '\r\nPretty bad as to my observation - unacceptable.', '\r\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Good place, although not having a POSH look!
