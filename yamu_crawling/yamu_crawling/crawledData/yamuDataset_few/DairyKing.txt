name: Dairy King
excerpt: Dairy King is a good place to stop by for ice cream - and fat chocolatey brownies - if you're in Galle Fort. 
yamu_review: ["Dairy King is hard to miss if you're in Galle Fort. It's a popular little stop run by a family, for all your ice cream and milkshake needs. They've got a decent range of flavours and one of the best brownies we've had in ages.", "They've got a ridiculously long list of options of juices, shakes, coffees and teas besides the ice cream. We just\xa0tried a bit of vanilla and cinnamon ice cream.", 'The ice cream on our visit were stocked away in little cups - we saw a whole bunch of flavours, including mint, coconut, cinnamon, lime, choc-chip and ginger. For Rs. 250, we think the ice cream you get here is worth it. It comes in a good size\xa0and is of a very strong flavour judging by our cinnamon.', "It was the brownies and ice cream that I really loved though. This is Rs. 450 but the brownie is pretty huge and amazing and they aren't stingy with the ice cream either, so it felt like value for money. The ice cream itself was alright, it wasn't as creamy as some home-made ice cream is but tasty enough. The brownie had little nuts in its thick chocolatey surface and was overall very soft and a dream for chocolate lovers.", 'Dairy King is in a great location, right at the end of Church Street, just a skip away from the ', ". Its blue and pink walls are impossible to miss and often you find the very friendly Dairy King himself, the founder of this ice cream stop, standing outside and luring people\xa0with the call of 'special home made ice cream'.", "Inside the pink walls is just the ice cream counter, so the seating is outside it. There are\xa0simple\xa0little garden chairs and checkered tablecloths, and if it's hot you can sit in the veranda where there's cushier seating.", "We like Dairy King, because ice cream. And especially in a fort that's known for its high prices, the prices here are\xa0quite\xa0kind on the wallet."]

We visited Kings dairy today just going by this review and it was such a disappointment. I ordered a coconut ice cream which had more ice than cream and my father's passion fruit was too tangy! Peddler's Gelato is a thousands times better and value for money. We will never go back! \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Tried the mint choc chip and crunchy cashew ice creams and sad to say that both were rock hard, not at all creamy, and full of ice crystals. The cashew one had a smattering of chopped cashew on top and only one or 2 bits in the rest of the tub. The lady in the shop was quite pushy about the flavors she wanted us to choose, urging us not to go for the mainstream ones and towards the more exotic ones, since the others are available elsewhere, which we felt was a fair argument. But we were disappointed for the reasons mentioned previously, especially as we made a special detour to find the place. \n                                            ']
