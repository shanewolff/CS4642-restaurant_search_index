yamu_review: ['Sri Vihar has been around for several years now, and we had\xa0heard that their ghee ', " are nice. Given the rumours (and the fact that it's been about three years since we last reviewed it), half of the Yamu staff decided to crash the restaurant for lunch on a gloomy Monday morning. There's nothing wrong with gloomy Mondays — I think rainy weather is epic, although half my colleagues would beg to differ. Anyway, moving on. The review of Sri Vihar awaits.", "This seems to be (pretty sure it is) one of those\xa0old bungalows that's been converted into an eatery. It's quite spacious, with huge arches separating the different areas of the hallway. With peeling paint and a slightly rundown appearance,\xa0it\xa0could possibly use a bit of renovation.\xa0But it's clean and decent otherwise.", 'The service was a bit disappointing because the staff were\xa0quite slow. We were seated for quite a while (around ten minutes or so) before a steward headed our way and handed over a couple of tattered menus. Once the food finally started coming though, the service picked up\xa0and the stewards were a bit more attentive.', "I've passed this joint so many times and had it recommended to me by a good friend, so I was expecting great things out of it. Sadly, this was not to be. Having dragged along a few of my fellow forever-hungry workmates (including my editor who's Indian, so we got instant feedback if what we had was\xa0legit or not), we settled down and selected more than we could eat. Mistake Number Two (after\xa0Mistake Number One, which was to expect great food).

The potato stuffing was really quite nice but lacking in salt. The condiments (sambar, chutney and all that) were also lacking in salt. The samosas were accompanied by a tamarind sauce which was interesting — quite thick and sweet, but surprisingly greasy, sporting an oil slick on top.\xa0', 'The ', ' were quite heavenly after this. Soft and light on the inside and fried to a light crisp on the outside, they disappeared\xa0in a matter of prolonged seconds.', "A nice chutney with this would have been great, but alas. I don't think Sri Vihar favours the use of\xa0salt, so the chutney on our table was a sad substitute for the tangy and\xa0flavourful condiment that is normally served alongside.\xa0", "The ghee roast we were so looking forward to was an utter disappointment because of how poorly it was prepared. There were clumps of dough on the inside, and it clearly hadn't been 'roasted' properly or for long enough. Add to that, we all got the strong flavour of margarine instead of the aroma of ghee. I think it was Astra. The dosai\xa0", '\xa0good enough though, coming in two long and\xa0perfectly rolled cylinders.\xa0', 'What you see under the ghee roast is the rava onion and cashew ', ' (because the steward rolled the ghee roast off a platter onto the platter of ', ' already on our table), which we found pretty epic. The ', '\xa0was light and crispy, and perfectly prepared with a really generous dose of sliced\xa0cashew nuts sprinkled throughout. Being roasted, the cashews had a pronounced nutty flavour, and went well with the crunchy, finely chopped\xa0onions.\xa0', 'This is what that glorious ', " looked like. I know it appears somewhat scrappy and messy, but it's well worth\xa0a go.\xa0It's a very interesting take on\xa0the traditional ", ' — and more importantly, they have got the formula right.', "Let's have a quick run through the other stuff we tried. Don't opt for the butter ", " unless you're partial to rubbery bread, 'cause that's what you're going to get. It was slathered in butter, but we\xa0missed that toasty, golden flavour of a well-prepped butter ", '. The ', " (spinach-and-paneer curry) was surprisingly good and had a tad more flavour than the sambars and other sauces which accompanied our dishes, but it was still underseasoned.\xa0(Why, Sri Vihar, WHY DON'T YOU USE SALT?)\xa0Also lacking salt and was the", ", which had the basic flavour and sourness right. But it didn't have much heat, and didn't have the sinus-clearing effect that this soup generally does.

The restaurant has changed its name to Sri Vihar and probably the management too. All the tuk tuk guys still call it as Shanti Vihar. It's a cafeteria style restaurant. The place is very clean, the food is excellent and very cheap comparatively to Mathuras or Shanmugas. Their Thosais, Oothappams are great and Chappathis too (those are the stuff I have tried). One thing that really gets to me is the time they take to get the stuff ready from the time you order. You can really save time if you call them well in advance (around 20-30 mins), before you stop by.
