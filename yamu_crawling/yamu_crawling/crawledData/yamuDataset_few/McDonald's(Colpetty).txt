name: McDonald's (Colpetty)
excerpt: As a food, McDonald's is pretty processed and nothing special, but as an experience it still has a real place in the global psyche. Sometimes you just want McDonald's. In that case the Colpetty outlet serves the usual McD fare with a few Sri Lankan twists.
yamu_review: ["McDonald's is McDonald's, but Sri Lankan franchises can vary widely. As franchises go, McDonald's is pretty reliable. They also have a range of Sri Lankan stuff, like McRice and the McSpicy and Seeni Sambol Bun.\r\n\r\n", "The Seeni Sambol is on the breakfast menu (before 10:30 AM). It's already quite popular and it is interesting. Basically a bun and egg with seeni sambol inside. The McDonald's seeni sambol is a bit more like a katta sambol with sugar, honestly, since the onion isn't especially noticeable. The spiciness is a nice addition to breakfast. We hear that it's already outselling the traditional breakfast options.\r\n\r\nBesides that new offering, the McSpicy (chicken) is pretty good and they now have wings and wraps. McDonald's fries remain excellent.\r\n\r\n", "The staff are well-trained and quite fast. Unlike in the abroad, McDonald's is a pretty good and relatively aspirational job in Sri Lanka and they get good people.\r\n\r\n"]

Until they sell decent burgers like the quarter pounder or the angus burger like they do overseas, it will always be this novelty place I personally believe.

Nice looking hot chicks were at service. It was so impressive. Some female staff members never hesitated to flirt around with guys coming over. That is what customers who come to such fastfood restaurants really want. Adequate good enough food and a romantic atmosphere. I really loved the place.

But would hope you guys can have a Mccafe like  Mcdonalds has in other countries where they serve different coffees, cakes sandwiches.  Also hope you can bring back the hotcakes.  They are perfect thing to have during breakfast time,  Mcdonalds in other coutries have it  why not here in Sri Lanka….\n                                            ']
