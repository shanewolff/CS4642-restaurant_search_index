excerpt: I often really want to go to Roots. Because it's hot, and occasionally they give you a really good smoothie. But more often you just get a warm drink and crappy service.

I simply dont trust roots any more and the guy who handled the situation was acting defensive and ignoring the complaint rather.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Yea I actually had the same problem with the odel roots they even do not listen what the customer is saying when ordering. I specifically asked for sugar to added for my juices and I got them with no sugar + when I told them about it the cashier acted rudely and said that "I didnt say that I needed sugar added" and its all due to those guys werent listening just chattering with the other staff members. But I actually like the nawala roots. friendly service and calm place to enjoy.   \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    The service didn't seem friendly as always.

I work close by so I frequent them quite often and have found both the service and the juice consistent. I've had a few occasions where they have actually re-made my juice, without me asking, rather than serving it to me bc it didn't taste quite right, and another time they said the juice I wanted wasn't turning out right, the fruit probably not ripe enough, and after trying twice they offered to change my order rather than give me a less than great juice. I can't comment on other branches, but Nawala does a great job.", '\n', '\nAgreed on Juiceez though, their juices are just ever so slightly fresher tasting.\n                                            ']
