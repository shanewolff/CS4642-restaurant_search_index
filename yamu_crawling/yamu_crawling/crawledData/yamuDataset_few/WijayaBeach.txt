excerpt: An old favourite, Wijaya Beach continues to serve up fresh seafood, excellent pizza and a sun-dappled ocean view. 
yamu_review: ["Wijaya Beach has been a consistent favourite and is known for serving up some of the best pizzas in town. The restaurant is perched directly above the sea as well, with waves crashing just below the terrace and sand-coated tourists waltzing in and out at ease. It's a typical beach resto with simple and delicious food, and, best of all, service that doesn't discriminate between locals and tourists.", "I haven't been here before, and was expecting something large and rather jungle-beach-ish from everything I'd heard about it: I mean, tables set on sand, marquees, long tables and benches and all that ", " . What I didn't expect was to walk in through an unobtrusive doorway and see a packed yet cosy building filled with loud music, chatter, and the smattering of waves.", "It's surprisingly not as crowded as you'd expect, but I reckon that's probably because this strip of sea isn't accessible off the road, so you'd have to be a guest of one of the beach houses or restaurants lining the shores.", "We sat around and waited for a while and then realized that we'd probably have to place our orders at the counter. It didn't seem like menus would be brought to the table; so we did it ourselves. When the waitstaff noticed me standing awkwardly around waiting to place my order (and noticed other people sort of go ahead of me), they waved me across and took down my orders: which I thought was pretty nice given how they didn't prioritize tourists like most touristy beach spots. They also made zero fuss when I changed my mind about the drinks, and were overall very brisk and friendly with service.", 'We opted for a half-and-half pizza with one side being feta and olives, the other being smoked chicken. The pizza was Rs. 1400.', 'Strangely, they also offer Sashimi (Rs. 800) so we got that too. Along with a side of Garlic Bread (Rs. 300).', "I say 'strangely', because that's pretty much the only Japanese dish in a place of pizzas and drinks. For the price, you get a plateful of tuna slivers, fresh and delicious with a sprinkling of lime and a quick, light dip in soya sauce that accompanies it. If you want some added heat, dab a bit of wasabi on as well.", 'One of the things I like most about this place is the lack of pretentiousness. The old building, the simple furniture, the presentation of the food and drink. Like for example, instead of mason jars, these guys simply recycle old bottles and jars for drinks and condiments. Like so:', "That is my Virgin Mojito (Rs. 500) in a jam or chutney jar, topped off with a couple of fresh and tiny flowers for what I assume is a cute effect. Those aren't the most edible of flowers though, so I put them away before drinking it. The soda to everything else ratio was a bit off though, as the lime and mint flavours were submerged by the former. Even after stirring thoroughly.", "We loved the garlic bread, nothing fancy but wonderfully executed. If food could be called rustic, I'd say this is it: chunks of your regular loaf of bread slathered with garlic butter and garnished with what I presume is some parsley. Despite its rather bland appearance, it was surprisingly flavoursome and crispy.", "Finally, Wijaya Beach's signature dish: the pizza. The toppings were balanced on chappati-thin dough that was quite soft overall except for the crispiness around the edges.", "I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken half because the meat was sparse: except for one slice which had a generous bit topping it. The other slices were quite bare, so the other flavours (of cheese and dough) overpowered it. On the other hand, the feta and olive half was on point: I loved the mix of green and black olives, especially as the pickled green ones added a nice tang to it. Also, there was a whole lot more cheese on this, which made for an overall satisfying and fulfilling meal. Between two of us, we didn't have any trouble finishing this\xa0off. They're all surprisingly light (or maybe we were just ravenous).", "Whenever you head down south and aren't sure where to dine out, make your way to Wijeya. Friendly staff, great views, and superb beach vibes are what you can expect.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A typical beach resto perched above the sea, dishing up simple and delicious food with a side of great service.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    It's hard to find fault with the superb seafood, crisp pizza and chilled-out beach vibe at Wijaya Beach. \n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Lovely whitewashed wood, colourful bunting lining the rafters, sun beds overlooking an emerald sea and warm wafts of air emanating from a large wood fire oven: Wijaya Beach is a delicious slice of island life serving the island's most delicious slices of pizza.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ලස්සන සුදු පාටින් වර්ණ ගැන්වූ ලී, තද කොළ පාට සමුද්\u200dරය දෙසට හැරවූ අව්ව තපින ඇඳන් සහ උණුසුම් වාතය පිටවෙන විශාල දරලිපෙන් පත්තුවන අවන: විජය බීච් කියන්නේ දිවයිනේ රසම පීට්සා හදන අවන්හලයි.\n                                                                                                                            ']

', '\n', '\nMost reviews mention that their pizzas are the best in Sri Lanka and honestly being a chef and a foodie who has tried pizzas in many restaurants and hotels in Sri lanka including colombo, galle, mirrisa, negombo, bentota; this was by far the worst pizza. The base was extremely soggy, burnt from the sides and raw in the middle, toppings so many, cheese so heavy that the pizza could not even carry the weight of it all. I am absolutely shocked how this place is so highly rated ', '\n', '\nApart from bad pizzas, I also did not like how close their chairs were. People literally sitting on top of one another. The only saving grace was their passion fruit mojito. \n                                    ']

The food is excellent but sadly you need to change your skin colour if you want to enjoy the service and that's bit difficult.  \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Disagree with Ken.

The pizza is simply divine (Harpos and PH need to take some lessons here) and so are the pastas and the prawn salad. Generous portions and the prices are reasonable. The place was PACKED when we were there on a Saturday but the service was good. The guy who was at the cash counter (I assume he is the owner) was friendly and somehow managed to make a table free for two. I am sold on this place. The loungers by the beach should be nice in the evenings although we could not find any free ones by the time we were there.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    @Ken, Stop whining without reason man, I'm Sri Lankan too and when I went the service was more than acceptable. Maybe it's your face. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Ken couldn't be more wrong about the service. We discovered this gem when we were staying in Talpe and have returned more than five times for their pizza and their laid back yet attentive service. I could not agree more on the review regarding the pizza and both my wife and I are huge fans of the stuff. In fact, since the opening of the highway, we find every excuse to make a trip down to Galle and devour a pizza or two. Also don't forget to try the ceviche, amazing! \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Ken has a severe inferiority complex and cant voice his order properly most likely. We were all brown in color and got top fast service & with a smile. There was another brown table and they also got supreme service from the few guys constantly hovering around taking orders…', '\r\n', '\r\nThe pizzas were great! We put away 4 for dinner and dont ask for extra anchovies they go to town on that! We also tried the sashimi tuna which was very very fresh! two orders of that went down pretty good with a lion - small lions only btw. The oysters were small so its not worth as much as what you get at ministry of crab for the same price…the icecreams with brownies was also quite good and worth a try.', '\r\n', '\r\nOur next trip will be to stay at Wijeya beach if we can get a room cuz the place was packed!!!!!', '\r\n', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Pizza… Meh.

I've been going to Wijaya for the past ten years or so and the food has always been exceptional. The service is not the greatest but the staff are very friendly and helpful and I never noticed any sign of racism. Only negative is that Mahendra keeps increasing the prices every six months and now the place is overpriced… Their prices are more than the Lagoon… Its a shame as the place is so chilled and the grub first rate.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Fantastic pizza in a very chilled out sea-side spot with a decent swimming beach too - be careful of the tide! The anchovie pizza was unreal as was the mixed seafood platter we got. Been here several times and not once has it disappointed. Service is ok - you get what you ask for.
