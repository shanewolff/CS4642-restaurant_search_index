name: Tea Blog
excerpt: The newest bubble tea joint in Colombo. They also do cakes, burgers, waffles and sandwiches.
yamu_review: ['Located down Baseline Road, Tea Blog is the latest bubble tea spot in town. Apart from bubble tea, they serve\xa0up a range of sandwiches, burgers, baguettes, waffles, and sandwiches.\xa0', 'They have three types of bubble tea; Fruity tea, Milk tea, and Tea Blog Specials. We tried one of each.', "The Lovers Paradise (Rs. 400) in their signature range didn't impress us. Originally, it was supposed to come with rose petal black tea, basil seeds and popping boba.\xa0But as\xa0there\xa0was a shortage of popping boba, they were kind enough to replace it with some preserved strawberries.", 'The bits of thinly sliced strawberries floating around\xa0were a nice touch, but we could barely get the tea taste in this. It literally felt\xa0like drinking a very sugary\xa0', "leaving your mouth all sticky.\xa0Needless to say, we didn't finish this.\xa0", "Their Nutella Waffle (Rs. 600) looked quite messy but we liked it. The waffle itself had a fluffy texture,\xa0crunchy edges and wasn't crazy-sweet, which worked well with the toppings.", 'Topped off with three small scoops of chocolate ice cream, and drizzled with Nutella, it was a very filling snack. Although, we wish it had fresh strawberries, instead of preserved ones.\xa0', 'We also tried their\xa0Chilli Cheese Sandwich (Rs. 350), which was quite alright. The bell pepper and mozzarella\xa0flavors emerged nicely through the perfectly toasted slices of bread.\xa0', 'The interior is decorated with cushioned benches, comfortable chairs, and warm lighting, which has given it the\xa0glimpse of contemporary elegance. It can easily accommodate 15-20 people at a time.', "Tea Blog\xa0is managed by some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. They’re very friendly, and attentive but unfortunately, they took around good 40 minutes to deliver our food and drinks to the table. It's highly unacceptable considering there were only four more customers apart from us.\xa0", "Tea Blog has been around for\xa08 months now\xa0and as we could see, it has become a popular spot among the working crowd around this area. Whilst\xa0they've got some good\xa0food and drinks, they definitely should work on improving their service.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A bubble tea spot with some good snacks. \n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    දෙමටගොඩ පැත්තෙන් ආව වෙලාවක බබල් ටී එකක් බීලා, පොඩි ස්නැක් එකක් වගේ කන්න ටී බ්ලොග් එක හොඳ තැනක්. \n                                                                                                                            ']
