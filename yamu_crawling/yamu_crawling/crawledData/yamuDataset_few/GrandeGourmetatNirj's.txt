name: Grande Gourmet at Nirj's
excerpt: Try-hard decadence that's not worth your money. Faux fine dining.
yamu_review: ["Grande Gourmet at Nirj's is a brand-new entry into Colombo's fine dining scene that promises more than it plates up. The owner, Nirj,\xa0Niranjan Deva Aditiya, is a patron of the Nth Degree,\xa0an exclusive dining club in London.", "He hopes to bring down guest chefs from Michelin-star restaurants to spice\xa0up their menu. Our Prime Minister dined here, opening the restaurant a few weeks ago, so that's some hype to live up to.\xa0Let's start with the promise of fine dining.\xa0French fine dining, to be precise.", 'There is no liquor on this menu. That means\xa0no wine. Grande Gourmet has not yet been able to secure a liquor licence.\xa0While ordering', "also\xa0bear in mind that this is their first menu. For starters, you can try seared scallops (Rs.1,500), salmon and spinach (Rs. 1,400), raw fish on avocado and apple (Rs. 1,300), and an\xa0exotic garden salad (Rs. 1,150). They've got the names and descriptions written in both French and English, if you fancy mispronouncing your order to the waiter.", 'By way of soup, the menu features two options: a\xa0', '\xa0and a ', ', both priced at Rs. 900.\xa0I was hoping to try a ', ", but they don't have one on the menu at the moment.\xa0", "Moving on.\xa0The mains. You can choose from seared duck breast (Rs. 2,200), steer fillet (Rs. 2,900), baked stuffed leg of chicken (Rs. 1,800) and\xa0herb-crusted rack of lamb (Rs. 2,900). There's also quite an array of seafood available, including\xa0lobster.\xa0", "They've got a special dessert of Bacardi blackberry crepes with ice cream (Rs. 1,290) and an assortment of cheese (Rs.1,950), plus sorbets, ice creams and apple tarts at Rs. 900.", 'For starters, we shared the scallops, or\xa0', 'A mouthful to pronounce,\xa0they were undercooked.', 'The two sides were unevenly seared. This dish was badly executed. The inside of the scallops was juicy but also tasted raw and fleshy in parts.\xa0The plating\xa0looked like green and orange goop in a ying-yang, and some tiny little blackheads in the guise of caviar. Ugh. \xa0', 'After our\xa0starters were\xa0taken away, the waiter brought\xa0little shot glasses\xa0with one single fried fish inside each. It was unmistakably a ', ", a word I'm not used to using in the singular.\xa0It came with compliments from the chef, but it didn't fit in with the rest of the courses and\xa0felt quite out of place for a French fine dining experience.\xa0It works as a good combination for gentrified Sri Lankan\xa0fast\xa0food:\xa0crunchy, tart and\xa0acidic.\xa0", 'On our second course, we\xa0shared the\xa0', ' (Rs. 900), because the combination sounded... interesting? A "sea of mixed mushroom veloute around an island of avocado guacamole with fig chutney" arrived. The bowl was\xa0served with just the guacamole and fig jam huddled together. Then, the waiter poured the creamy mushroom soup over it. I enjoyed the effort put into some table-side action.\xa0The fig chutney\'s sweetness was the only bright note in this dish.\xa0The avocado guacamole got lost in the creamy soup, and was soon overpowered by the flavour of the mushrooms.', '\r\n', "Soup consumed, we were each\xa0served a wild berry sorbet as a palate\xa0cleanser. It didn't cleanse my palate. The sorbet's intense tart and sweet flavour hit hard, and left me with an aftertaste that I had to undo by swilling some water. It would make for a great dessert, though, and is available as an option.\xa0", "For the third course, we\xa0had the lamb and Nirj's signature salmon (Rs. 2,700). The lamb and the salmon arrived simultaneously. Without checking with me,", 'they had decided that I would enjoy my lamb done medium-well, which seemed\xa0to be the safest route, but it was unevenly cooked.\xa0The gravy was too salty, the mash was ', ', and the presentation was sloppy. What was peculiar about this course was that we were served our mains on greyish-blue plates, unlike all the other courses that were served on white plates. Maybe they were going for contrast? I felt that the ambience of the room was already overdoing the contrast game, so it was a bit over the top given all that.', "The signature salmon skin\xa0was crisp, but bitter in parts. The flesh was overcooked but somehow managed to look pink and\xa0flaky. My date liked the flakiness, but I didn't.\xa0The fancy cheese sauce\xa0(Roquefort)\xa0was fancy, but I\xa0didn't get\xa0enough of it because she nicely went at it.\xa0\xa0This dish was\xa0well-seasoned, according to her. I agreed.\xa0Both plates had pretty much the same look going on, we noted, from the grayish-blue plates to the accompanying veggies. We both avoided the tomato with breadcrumbs. I tried a nibble and it just didn't work for me. The crumbs fell off and weren't crisp or crunchy enough to really provide an interesting experience of contrast with the textures at play here.", 'Dessert. We split a warm apple tart (Rs. 900). It had\xa0apple slices sitting on a crisp, flaky pastry, with a little dollop of okay ice cream and a strawberry.\xa0The ice cream tasted quite milky and the whole thing tasted like breakfast cereal. So, yeah.\xa0', 'What the actual French. Colour\xa0clash. Green ceiling. Red carpet. Blue plates. Yellow tablecloth.\xa0Metal tables. Plastic chairs painted gold. Faux velvety cushion.\xa0Oh, and where I was seated, you could still see the pencil marks that the decor team had\xa0left behind.\xa0', "The colour of the walls and the choice of lighting really don't let the food show its true colours, and that's a bit worrying given that you might not see just how well your meat or seafood is cooked. And there are\xa0apples on the table. Every table for two comes with a green apple and a red apple that just sit there awkwardly in front of the salt and pepper dishes.\xa0They're real. We checked. Awks.", "We didn't feel like the service matched what we paid for, and that left us feeling quite disconnected from the experience.", "Our bill for two came to Rs. 10,000 with tax, so, that's about Rs. 5,000 per head, while splitting the starter, the soup and the dessert.\xa0Don't waste your time and money. I'm sorry, but this just felt like a bourgeois, try-hard decadent diner with exorbitant prices.\xa0If you want real fine dining, go to a five-star hotel. If you'd like to try Nirj's, wait until they get their liquor licence\xa0and sort out their set\xa0menus.\xa0"]
