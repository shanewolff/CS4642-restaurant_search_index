yamu_review: ["Santoré Bistro Italiano is an Italian restaurant hidden behind the Sri Lanka Tennis Association. It's one of Colombo's better options for Italian fare, serving up stellar pizza and a range of pasta. They are relatively new to the scene, but they've built a good reputation over the years, amassing a formidable customer base that you can bear witness to on a Saturday evening. We dropped in for dinner to try out their pasta and secondi, as we generally\xa0try\xa0their pizzas and those have never disappointed.", "We started off with Bruschetta Santoré (Rs 375). You get two pieces of bread with tomato sauce, mozzarella and capers with some oregano sprinkled on top. I personally prefer bruschetta when it's got diced tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella, so this wasn't satisfactory.", "Since they make their own pasta, we tried the Tortellini Panna E Prosciutto (Rs 1300). It's a tiny little pasta that's filled with minced beef, minced pork and mortadella. It's usually served with white cream but we were advised that it can be a little heavy and take away from the actual flavour of the filling, so we opted for olive oil and parmesan instead. If you're feeling fancy, you can ask for truffle oil and they will indulge you.", "For meat, we tried the Filetto Di Maiale Al Miele (Rs 1400). Basically, pork fillet with a honey glaze served with potatoes. There's lots of rosemary and cumin that really livens up this dish. We found the pork to be a bit tough, but it was still quite delicious. It's just enough for two to share, if you've ordered something else as well.", "Our dessert featured\xa0the Tortino\xa0Al Cuore Morbido (Rs 700). It's basically a lava cake, and hands down the best one I've had. The chocolate is not too sweet and it's so soft on the outside and gooey on the inside. We wish they would make their own gelato, though, as the ice cream was just average.\xa0", "The staff at Santoré have improved. Ask for Sanath as he's well-versed with the menu. On most days, they'll get your food to you pretty quick. Fridays and Saturdays\xa0tend to be packed, though, so service can suffer. The ambiance is pretty chilled out. You can watch them prepare the pizza if you sit indoors, or, if it's earlier in the evening, the outdoor area is nice.\xa0", "Having tried the pasta and meat options, we think Santoré is best for their pizza. They are a bistro, so you can't expect five-star hotel service from them, but their staff is quite capable. They do delivery even in the pouring rain, which is pretty commendable.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Santoré Bistro Italiano is one of Colombo's better options for Italian fare, serving up stellar pizza and a range of pasta.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    In the latter half of 2013, Santoré was the newest Italian restaurant to join the fray.

The thin crust pizza had fresh ingredients but lacked taste. The penne pasta dish we also ordered could have been little more than the instant stuff mixed with a can of pureed tomatoes.  The salad was mediocre and you could fix something more interesting at home. Every dish could have done with more generous additions of everything from garlic to the herbs that one expects from italian dishes. Also: do not go there in your own car when there is any kind of activity from the SLTA - they own the car park where Santore is located but take no responsibility for ensuring there is any sense of order in how cars are parked (a security guard only stands at the gate) nor do they place any signs alerting drivers to this. When we left the restaurant we found that someone had parked in front of our car and we hung around for 45 mts in the parking lot until SLTA could find a way to get them out - apparently they have no system in place to prevent this from happening.  Another problem is that the restaurant is very small and gets very loud when more than 1 table is occupied.  This is worsened by the fact children and adults involved in the SLTA activities often walk into the restaurant just to get the benefit of the AC and so the restaurant itself never became comfortably cool. Perhaps the ambience is quieter at night when you can sit out, but the food was not worth it.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    what are the booze options like? can you bring your own?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The service at this restaurant is a joke.

Will definitely be a regular here -- and subsequently also at Independence to work off all those extra Italian carbs.

There is no point using expensive Pasata for the pizza base. Concentrated MD tomato puree with garlic blended will work fine. To those who ate the Four Cheese Pizza the Gorgonzola Cheese is very strong and this will overcome the taste issues in the other areas. The Pizza could be rolled thinner how that my personal pref. Little fine tuning to be done and all in all can work out ot be a real nice spot to chill at.

The walk to the restaurant from the car park felt very eerie and the restaurant was located right at the end with no lights along the pathway.  When we got there the interior comprised of a few wooden tables and chairs clumsily put together in a small space.  Overall not a good first impression but still decided to give it a try hoping the food would be mind blowing! I'd have to agree with foodie on a number of accounts. When there is more than one table occupied it gets really loud and the AC did not work so it was rather hot, overall it was very unpleasant. The sets of cutlery on the tables did not match and looked like something you brought from different houses just for that day! (and knives with plastic handles!!!) Now to the food, I had the penne pasta with chicken and as Foodie rightfully put it across it was just pasta and chunks of chicken mixed with garlic and what was probably MD canned tomatoes pureed! An utter disappointment! The Carbonara too was mediocre and nothing to write home about. Overall the food and ambiance turned out to be a bitter disappointment.  If the management of Santore Bistro Italiano are serious about this they should really up their game and provide good quality food and a suitable atmosphere to enjoy it. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Tried the pizza diavlo.

The pasta which was supposed to be quite rich and creamy  did not have any such taste in it - it was at best plain buttered spaghetti loaded with pepper and chunks of cut ham. The fact that they forgot to add cheese from the looks and taste of it was just plain ridiculous (we all know cheese of any kind costs a lot in SL). As for the taste, think of Maggi noodles fried up on a pan (not the soup style) peppered up, and then add some cut cubes of ham in - this is what was served pretty much. Either every other carbonara I had tried in my life was incorrectly made or this one was so off base - it was this one!", '\n', '\nWe will not order Santore again as it seems the ownership and management have succumbed to the food failure curve.

We ordered the Bruschetta which came with Veg Tempura (weird combo i thought Rs 950) and both were soaking in oil.  Then we ordered the Diavola which again was soaking in oil and did not taste good nor authentic in any way. Wish they can get their act together again cos like I said its a great place with superb service which at the end of the night made us go home happy anyway…  \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I think quality has dramatically deteriorated from the last time we visited the place\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    So Santore\'s put up heaps of advertisements, and even created an event for their Friday aperitivo, touting free tapas and 1 for 1 on cocktails/cosmos all night. Turned up at like 9 with a friend, and they denied all responsibility, even though we showed them their own FB ads. After about 25 minutes 3 waiters, each of whom gave us completely contradictory information, they gave us 4 pieces of  rusk with like Marmite  on top, and gave us 1 free cosmo "as a favour". It tasted like lime, cough syrup, and dissapointment.

directions: Santore is located right inside the Sri Lanka Tennis Association, behind the Lifestyles Gym. On the main road it's between the Green Path roundabout and the National Museum. There's some big trees and a parking lot. Walk basically in to Lifestyles and continue down the path till it ends at the tennis courts. Santore is on your right.
