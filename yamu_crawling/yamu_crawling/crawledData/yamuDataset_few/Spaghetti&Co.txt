name: Spaghetti & Co
excerpt: This Hikkaduwa institution does decent Italian.
yamu_review: ["We also tried the prawn and pesto gnocchi (Rs. 990). Again, a hefty portion but nothing magical flavorwise. The gnocchi was heavy and the pesto and prawn wasn't a great combination. This pasta was all right, but nothing to write home about.", "Our overall impression of the food here was that it's average Sri Lankan Italian.", "Spaghetti & Co has a big spacious verandah at the end of the Hikkaduwa Strip (on Galle Road). It's really big and airy and well lit. It's a great location, set back in a garden home.", "When we went it wasn't busy at all. The service was quite good, just a nice lady who took our order and brought it out.", "Spaghetti & Co isn't the best Italian food you'll get on the coast, but it's pretty good and has a really nice location.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Spaghetti & Co is a Hikkaduwa institution, serving up Italian fare for as long as I can remember.
