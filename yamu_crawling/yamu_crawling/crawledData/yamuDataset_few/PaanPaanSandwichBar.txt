The Spicy Baked Chicken is the best. However, their almond milk was just bland and not as good as Yamu says. And because of this they should seriously increase the number of beverages they have.

The sandwiches are always consistently good. I've have the chicken and beef. They serve good roast beef (although probably not made in house), unlike Crusty's that uses the processed kind. Provided that the Alfred House Road one is mostly like a pick up place, I do think the staff could go a little out of their way to be faster and efficient, they basically disappeared inside and couldn't be found. Price wise, not to bad, your looking at around 350 - 400 for filling sandwich.

I visited them today after a gap of about 10 months  and was disappointed at how much their standards had dropped. The same sandwich came with a little chicken filling, two tiny, thin slices of tomato, and a sparse sprinkling of lettuce sandwiched between slices of dry bread. Of course the price had increased by 30 %!   Definitely not recommended any more. \n                                            ']
