user_comments: ["\n\n                                    You guys should review the Maldivian restaurant mentioned in this post. So many Maldivian's in Colombo and we are so close to them but we know so little about their food compared to South Indian cuisine.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Been there a few times in the past and liked it.', '\r\n', "\r\nWent there last night and we didn't get any service for about half an hour. It wasn't even a busy night for them, and the others who were there before us also looked like they were waiting for someone to come to their table. We decided to relocate to Station, where the attention was only mildly better.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Used to be good but the service started getting poorer and poorer. Portions started getting smaller and smaller and the people who served us seemed to mess up the bill every time. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    It was a nice place some time ago.we had a party couple of time there last year.The service was ok.But recently ,their prices have increased massively at the same time quality of the food droped.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The quality of the food is very bad I bought hot butter Cuttle fish in which only flour was there no cuttle fish in it mostly… Price was 600 but for the same price mount grill and Lion pub provides better food… The mixed fried rice was even worse…\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have been to this place, its awesome… u can be there till 2am and have ur drinks. Foods were tasty and they serve neatly… It is a good place to have drinks with :)\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Went there last Sunday with a friend. Not crowded. Not the greatest either but relaxing. My friend noticed the prawns were old (maybe morning thawed) but they replaced them fast and no fuss. Maybe they added them to the bill!! Could do with some sprucing up and it will be a better place to chill out at!', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Food horrible staff Rip offers(Carefull) price is definetly expensive for the quality of food and most of all this is a shady joint not worth your hard erned money to be spent.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    never go to this place they rip money too much lanie place and food i so bad\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    it is one of the coolest beach spots in and around. food is pretty alright and Its BYOB so its even more great. it can get over crowded specially during the weekends. so the service is extra delayed…but i think i give my thumbs up anyday for lani's. they have another resort in walla Lani'2 its a great place too.\n                                            "]
