You dont have to worry. all the things in the menu are halal. The only thing is you have to stop breathing when you go to that area as there are other shops that carry food that are not certified. So the 'air' you breath become 'haram' . So prepare not to breath when you spend time eating 'halal' food.\n                                            "]
