name: The Bread Company (German Artisan Bakers)
excerpt: The Bread Company does excellent breads, sausages, pickles and more, and they do some of the  best sandwiches in the city and a good breakfast if you want to dine in.
yamu_review: ["The Bread Company was one of our favourite new restaurants back in 2014. They've kept things fairly hush-hush in the recent past, but their bread is still excellent, they've expanded their menu with a bunch of new meat options and still manage to keep things pretty lean and healthy.", 'Before The Bread Company set up shop in Colombo, they first gained popularity at ', ' for their breads. They initially set up their space in Thimbirigasyaya along with two other brands (', " and Green Chilli), but now they’ve got the space to themselves. They haven't tried to change things up too much, but they’ve introduced a number of new meat options, a few breakfast combos and desserts, all of which are homemade. Prices are on the mid to high end so expect to pay between Rs. 500 - Rs. 1000, but their stuff is very filling.", 'Their breads are probably still their best sellers with the sourdough, rye, multi seed and wholemeal going for Rs. 400 for 500g and the nutty going for Rs. 100 more. They start baking before the crack of dawn, so the breads are usually available as early as 6.45 AM.', 'The Bread Company was always good with their cured meats, but now they’ve expanded on that introducing more variations of sausages (parsley mix, smoked), roast beef, baby back bacon and roast pork. We tried the smoked pork sausage and it was easily one of the best we’ve had. The moment you taste this you know it’s all pork with no fillers. The seasoning isn’t too aggressive either, so the flavour of the pork really comes through with barely any fatty pieces.', 'All of their sandwiches are priced at Rs. 450, but these are larger than a burgers at most places. You can choose from any of the available meats so you’ve got chicken, beef, pork and salmon. We chose the BLT and we like the fact that they let you choose either fresh tomatoes or tomato paste (which is what I went with). The two main factors here are the bread and the baby back bacon which along with the lettuce makes for brilliant combo of textures. The bacon was crispy but not overly oily or salty so the balance was also just right.', 'The Bread Company’s main focus seems to be breakfast, so they offer some really hearty omelettes. At Rs. 900 it’s pricey but these are packed full of veges and meat. What you see in the photo is actually a half portion which was plenty filling in itself. This one came with roast chicken, green and yellow peppers, onions and carrots.', 'Their peanut butter cups (Rs. 250) are a new addition, and a brilliant one at that. These are like Reese’s peanut butter cups, only bigger and better! It’s packed with chunky peanut butter which is lightly salty and sweet, with little crispy bits which make it so enjoyable. We caved and got another one to go..', 'They’ve also introduced a German coffee as of late and it’s quite good. We tried the macchiato (Rs. 350), which was creamier than contemporary cafe macchiatos. The coffee itself is not bitter at all so that’s something to keep in mind when choosing which to go with.', 'When The Bread Company first opened up, the space had barely any seating so most people were getting their food to go. Now they’ve changed the entire set up rearranged the space so that there’s seating for around twenty.', "The service at TBC is as good as it gets. They’re super friendly and they’ll take the time to explain any details you want to know about the dishes or preparation of meats. It's a very personal experience which we wish was more common. Their also super fast so you won't find yourself waiting for more than ten minutes for your food to be ready.", 'The Bread Company is one of the few restaurants that’s managed to maintain their high standards from the beginning. They’re stuff isn’t cheap, but it’s incredibly high quality and they taste great.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Bread Company does excellent breads, sausages, pickles and more, and they do some of the  best sandwiches in the city and a good breakfast if you want to dine in.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    We love this place.

A no frills unhurried place ideal for a catch up with old friends. Its like sitting in your own country kitchen with staff ever ready to bring food and drinks as and when you want.

Coffee including Cappuccinos and espressos are under Rs 350/- They also serve fresh juices.', '\n', '\nWhen many Colombo restaurants are chickening out of pork, the Bread Company is a Pork lovers Haven. Flock here for quality pork sausages, Real pork bacon and roast pork sandwiches.', '\n', '\nAlthough it is a very small place, many trained chefs work in the kitchen at any time. So service is fast because it is almost overstaffed but that’s to ensure quality and speed.', '\n', '\nThey open early, at 7 am for breakfast but close by sunset. A hearty breakfast is around Rs. 1,000/- and many breakfast options are available, and whipped up very efficiently. Their mustard sauce is exceptionally good.', '\n', '\nMany items are reasonably priced. For instance, Brownie slabs with walnuts are only Rs. 400/- and Bacon and egg Buns are Rs. 200/- and they are big and also the best Bacon and egg Buns in town with real bacon and lots of stuffing. Hefty made to order sandwiches are Rs450/-. However, the cupcakes at Rs 350/- for a small cup cake is far too expensive. Government taxes are included in all the prices but a 10% Service charge is added even on takeaways.', '\n', '\nThe messy toilet and the lukewarm coffee really need to be improved but the relaxed setting and the food make up for the shortfalls.\n                                    ', '\n                                            ', '\n                                    ', "\n                                            They've got great value for money when it comes to their breakfast options!

Had their gourmet sausage bun with sweet relish onions. It was awesome. The person was very helpful as we tried to go out because we didn't see much food items and he gave us the options. He mentioned that the Bread Company is yet to come (which is there now). The buns were bit pricey. However the place was cozy and good for a bite on the way home after work. :)\n                                    "]
