name: Fountain Cafe
excerpt: Elephant House Fountain Cafe is a photocopy of a once historical watering hole. John Keells bought Elephant House and shut down 'non-performing' brands like the once popular Fountain Cafe, only reopening the place recently. Now the fountain is still there but the cafe is wedged behind a supermarket, literally at the end of aisle 10.

You select your choice of meat/fish/poultry from the meat counter… and ask them to cook it for you in any way you like. Charge: only 200 rupees per kilo (minimum order or 500 gms). We had some grilled seer fish, which was still piping hot and delicious after we came home from doing our groceries!! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    My favourite is shredded pork fried rice.

However the café needs some vertical blinds as all shoppers keep staring and it is rather odd and uncomfortable to have your meal without people gawking.  The staff is a little short but the current staff provides excellent service. It is a lovely place to visit with your family and friends… \n                                            ']
