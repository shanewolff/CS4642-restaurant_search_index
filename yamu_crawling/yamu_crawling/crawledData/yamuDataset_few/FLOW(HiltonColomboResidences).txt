name: FLOW (Hilton Colombo Residences) 
excerpt: FLOW is a restaurant at the Hilton Residences that serves up  a variety of international and local cuisines. 
yamu_review: ["The buffet at FLOW has been a popular go-to for the white-collared masses for a while now. They have an a la carte menu with a few interesting dishes but their buffets are what they're known for. \xa0The ingredients are extremely fresh and they offer a massive spread.", "It is highly recommended that you make a reservation before you go. They'd reserved a single table for me in a perfectly quiet corner away from the noise and people.\xa0", "The interior is posh, with dim yellow lighting directly overhead. It casts a massive shadow over your food and makes taking pictures a chore. If you're here to Instagram, bring a portable light source with you or reconsider your life choices. The furniture is basic, with most of the attention being focused on the serving stations.", "Their main attractions are their in-house chefs, who make\xa0sure the food is always topped up. It's presented in pans over low heat so it's always hot-hot and fresh.", "They offer a multitude\xa0of cuisines such as Western, Indian, Asian, and local. There's also a ton of different types of salads,\xa0hors d'oeuvres and so on. Their sushi options are incredibly limited with three types of rolls; a cucumber roll, tuna roll and California roll which you can see in the picture above.\xa0", "When I asked, the hostess told me that they specialise in Western cuisine. They had herb encrusted fish fillets, chicken cacciatore,\xa0grilled polenta and a manner of grilled vegetables. Problem is, these had little to absolutely no seasoning coming through despite the food looking bright and inviting. I'm okay with bland food but most of it tasted like water.", "Trying my best to sample as much as I could from the large spread, I came to the conclusion that what they specialise in is the Indian food.\xa0The naan was light, with soft, pillowy corners. The dhal was fantastic. It's probably the best dhal I've had at any restaurant.", '\r\nIf you find yourself drawing a blank amidst the counters, opt for the beef or chicken satay. Both were equally filling and the meat was juicy and pretty much perfect.\xa0', "As with all buffets, their noodle station is a winner. With a choice of either Tom Yum or Chicken Soup, you get to pick and choose what you like and the chef will put it all together for you. The Tom Yum soup is excellent and you'll be forced to spend more time than you have so you can sit down and enjoy each and every spoonful.\xa0", '\r\n', ' \xa0', "Dessert is alright, with a plethora of different cakes and puddings. There's also a waffle/ice-cream kotthu counter so you can indulge in either if you feel like it.", "The chefs are super-eager to help out if you need it. The waitstaff are alert, they're always topping up glasses of water and they\xa0regularly check up on their patrons.\xa0", "\r\nOne thing I'll have to remark on is the fact that the waiter who was tending to my table got a tad too friendly. I'm all for friendly conversation and I was rather enjoying his overall pleasant conversation, but at one point he asked me a few personal questions; 'Where do you live?' 'Where's your hometown?' etc. I don't entertain such questions so I ignored him and eventually he stopped.\xa0", "The entire buffet costs Rs. 3000 (inclusive of taxes) and while we're not sure we'd spend that much on lunch again, it's still a good buffet if you feel like a splurge or if you've got business people/clients to entertain.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    FLOW at the Jaic Hilton does a full buffet perfect for business lunches.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    FLOW is a restaurant at the Hilton Residences' that serves up  a variety of international and local cuisines. \n                                                                                                                            "]

I didn't had anything at all to eat… i even complained the one of their chef who was standing outside; about my total idea on this place.no verities and not worth for the money which spent… Kingsburry buffet is far more better than this and have plenty of food varieties to eat and price wise lower that this too. This is not worth at all and i think people should skip this place as its just a waste of money.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Went there yesterday (15AUG'16):", '\r\n', '\r\n1 x Dinner buffer                           2488.16', '\r\n2 x Carlsberg  0.625 (large)       1500.00', '\r\nSub total                                                 3988.16', '\r\nSC                                                                   398.82', '\r\nTax                                                                  628.37', '\r\nGRAND TOTAL                                   5015.35 (46.26 SGD / 44.86 AUD) ; ', '\r\n', '\r\nPROS:', '\r\n(1.)

I guess I paid more attention to the food today because normally I'm in and out for a quick meal during lunch time on weekdays. The service was not great. Starting with the drinks, the iced tea was diluted and lacked flavor. The bottom of the glass wasn't wiped properly and some pink liquid was all over my placemat. Moving on to the meal, the salad bar was ok. Penne pasta was under cooked and very dry. The main spread was so poor! No chicken! No grilled chicken no tandoori or tikka at the Indian station, the egg hopper they made for me was sooo burnt the black burnt stuff was all over my fingers! My friend ordered a pasta which they never brought to our table and when he walked back (after his meal) to the salad bar to speak to the manager the chef hands him the pasta saying he couldn't find where my friend was sitting to bring it over!! Great service Hilton! Wasn't worth the money we spent. I took the guests out to treat them and I was embarrassed as they couldn't find something they could eat and enjoy! Won't be recommending \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Went for dinner today. The ambience was alright but the service wasn't good.

There was no one at the pasta stand until I asked what was being served there from another chef and then someone rushed over to the station. Just poor service and poor spread.
