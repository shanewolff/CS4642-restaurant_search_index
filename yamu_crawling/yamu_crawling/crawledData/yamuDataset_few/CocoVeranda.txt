excerpt: Coco Veranda on Ward Place is one of Colombo's most popular coffee shops. We loved them in the past, but this time around it was a let down.
yamu_review: ["Coco Veranda's a familiar sight down Ward Place, and has a loyal customer base who continues to clamour for their sugar-heavy drinks and decadent cakes and desserts. They also offer a variety of burgers, pastas, and your regular cafe fare.", "Coco's service used to be great once upon a time, but has dropped as of the last two years. It certainly hasn't improved much since our last review, with items arriving late and half the staff looking too preoccupied. There was one person behind the counter though, who had a permanent smile, was welcoming, and helpful. One thing though, everything took quite a long time to get to the table. The sandwich took just over 15 minutes, and then we had to ask for and wait a bit more for the dessert, which is weird because it's already prepared and just sitting there anyway. When we asked for an extra plate and table water, those took close to 10 minutes to get to us — definitely too long to wait for just a plate.", "Ambience has remained pretty much the same, and that's where Coco has nailed it. Dim yellow lighting, dark brown wooden furniture, a good playlist — it's a great location for a quiet conversation.", "Mostly popular for their chocolate-heavy concoctions which are well executed, their food isn't half bad.", "We went for a Peri Peri Sandwich which was Rs. 590. They told us to pick our bread preferences, and we opted for a brown baguette — the bill later showed me that there's an extra charge (of 70 rupees) separately for that, which is kind of ridiculous given that the bread isn't an add-on. ", 'With just enough nicely spiced chicken sandwiched in the warm bread, it had a few really thick slices of tomato and a fresh bit of lettuce added in. Was this a good sandwich? It was alright. Was it worth 700+ rupees? No, not really.', 'We ', ' like the Cinnamon Mocha with Salt and Pepper though.', "Priced at Rs. 610, it was a definite treat especially if you're having it on a gloomy, rainy evening and when you're curled up with a book. As with many amazing drinks, what hits you first is the ", ". Who'd ever have thought that pepper could taste so good? In this, it does.", "The Chocolate Mint Blend (Rs. 680) is also a winner in our books because of how consistently perfect it is. Basically a very well executed milkshake, it's blended with just the right amount of mint. If you're going to have anything else with this, don't, because that's how filling this is. You're basically going to be in a chocolate-induced food coma soon after getting this down.", "On the down side, we really didn't like the Cappuccino (Rs. 470). It had a bitter, burnt aftertaste to it which we've experienced before with a bunch of their other coffees over the last year or two as well. This is one of the reasons I opt for the chocolatey or fruity drinks here instead of the caffeinated ones, but had to try this out just to give it a go.", "For dessert, we got the Chocolate Caramel Slice (Rs. 340) and a Mississippi Mud Pie (Rs. 360). The caramel slice had a very thick coconut base to it, which was unexpected and not wholly welcome when you're not expecting coconut in your caramel slice. The coconut flavour overpowered everything else, and as two people who love caramel and aren't massive fans of coconut, this was rather disappointing.", 'On the other hand, the mud pie was really good — decadent and dense, the chocolate was rich and filling and the whipped cream was light and fresh.', "We haven't had happy experiences with Coco's coffees for a couple of years now, but we do love their desserts and most of their other drinks. They've pretty much nailed it in terms of ambience and could up their service, it could be quite a satisfactory experience overall.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Coco Veranda's a familiar sight down Ward Place, and has a loyal customer base who continues to clamour for their sugar-heavy drinks and decadent cakes and desserts\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Coco Veranda on Ward Place is one of Colombo's most popular coffee shops.

I get a lot of work done there and have quite a few meetings so tend to spend a good amount cash there. The food is really good, it's great value and is served in good time! The burgers, the English breakfast and the chicken great and veg with mash potato are top notch and as good as any of the same that I have had in expensive restaurants in the UK. The breakfast tea is always perfect for me too. A big down side is that the wifi and internet access is on a Tartuffe and runs out towards the end of the month, this has been 2 consecutive months now that the last week of the month has no wifi! You do notice that it is a lot quieter on these days! I take my own 4g router so get what I need. But they are loosing money by penny pinching g and not paying for extra Gigs for their customers. I have mentioned this to the staff and they seem embarrassed by the owners reluctance to facilitate the customers needs. The service is typical Sri Lankan! Need I saw more? I won't criticise the waiters as they are doing their best and are all a great group of individuals. But it's Sri Lanka and that means the service will be what it is. I have had a few issues here with my credit card being charged twice, got a refund, but the terminal requires replacing but again, the owners will see this as a spend and won't replace it. In typical Sri Lankan style, if their is an issue, the waiters and managers will make any complaint look like it's your fault, they NEVER take ownership of a problem and never admit it's their fault. Coco Veranda is particularly skilled in this Sri Lankan attribute. Conclusion, great place that is let down by the owners lack of investment into the wifi, electric points and plug sockets, a leak in the smoking area ceiling and an out of date payment terminal. A word of advice to the staff and manager, don't make a customer complaint a customers fault, take responsibility and act.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Internet and wifi down again.
