excerpt: Besides one dish, Moon River gave us nothing to be happy about. We honestly cannot recommend it with all the new alternatives in Colombo.
yamu_review: ["Moon River is a member of the old guard of Chinese restaurants in Colombo is always full. While large crowds usually means good food, that wasn't the case for us. The food here is mediocre and the service for locals is not good. ", "Lately we've seen a a deterioration in quality among older Chinese restaurants, and it seems Moon River is no exception.", "For the carb base of our meal, we tried the deep fried Shanghai noodles with seafood (Rs. 998 for S). While the noodles are deep fried, it's a wet dish, which we hoped would  be a nice contrast. It wasn't. The fried noodles just ended up soggy and the whole thing ended up like a tasteless soup. While there were plenty of prawns and calamari in the noodles, the dish was under-seasoned and bland.", "The hot butter cuttlefish (Rs. 698 for S) wasn't too impressive either. While the texture of the batter and the cuttlefish were fine, this too lacked the seasoning and that kick of chilli that really helps the overall flavour of a good HBC. There were dried chillies in this one but just sprinkled over the top which doesn't really bind to anything.", "The salt and pepper chicken (Rs. 598 for S) was okay, but nothing to write home about. It's very simple preparation with lightly batter fried chicken cubes, tossed in salt and pepper, served with diced tomatoes and onions. After the bland noodles and HBC we were just glad to finally taste some salt and pepper.", 'After our recent feature on where to get ', ", we got a recommendation for the village style pork (Rs. 998) at Moon River. We gave it a shot and it turned out to be quite nice indeed. It's mostly pork belly prepared like a stir fry with a good amount of soy. The downside here is that it's equal parts pork to green beans and green chillies. The beans and chilli are nearly indistinguishable from each other, making the dish a bit of a minefield. Just keep a cup of water handy.", "Price-wise, they're not too bad. Small dishes are priced at around Rs. 550 and large is around Rs. 850. The only issue is that not all the dishes are available in small and large, with the more specialized ones available only in a single portion size, which seems to be too much for two and too little for four. One good thing is their menu has images for every single dish, albeit only vaguely accurate.", 'Service at Moon River left much to be desired. They have both local and Chinese waiters with each catering to their respective clientele. While the Chinese waiters seemed so nice to the Chinese customers, the local waiters were dismissive at best. Before coming to our table the waiter gave us a look that pretty much translated to "why are you even here?", perhaps because we dropped in at the end of the lunch service. While the food came to the table fast, the poor customer service left a bad impression.', "We don't think they've done any real improvements to the interior since the place first opened up. They've also stuffed as many tables as humanly possible in here, so be prepared to hear the entire conversation the folks at the neighboring tables are having. You'll also most likely be flailing your arms around quite a bit to keep the flies off the food.", 'Besides that one pork dish, Moon River gave us nothing to be happy about, which leads us to wonder how they have such large crowds.

We ordered Indonesian fish and some pork thing (can't remember the name) but it was all great stuff.

There were some left overs from the dishes that were already left , We requested for them also be packed to go. Suddenly all the dishes that were sent back initially to be packed to go had vanished but the bill included them anyways, when inquired about it the waiters and the asshole of an owner started to take apart the already packed left overs in front of everyone to show that the sent back portions were also put together with the left owners , There was 1 large rice dish, 1 Mixed vege, 1 eggplant and one other which we could not remember. Either all of the portions had suddenly shrunk in quantity or they had served it to someone else. It was not my treat else I would have thrown a tantrum there . I tried to talk some sense into the bastard but my  buddy who was giving the treat said its not worth it and the fact that his parents were also there.', '\r\nShould chase these assholes out of the country if they cannot carry out a fair business !!!', '\r\n', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Food was good but we were misled, too, by the owner.

We found out when it was time to pay, by which time, of course, it was too late. When the waiter went to ask, he explained to them. When he later walked past our table, he did not deign to even stop and explain or apologize for the "misunderstanding." This after warmly taking our order (perhaps because my wife speaks fluent Chinese?) when we first sat down. Frankly, no matter how good the food was, I will not go back and give my business to a crook. I hope he enjoys his ill-gotten gains.
