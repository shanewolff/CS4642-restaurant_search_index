name: Long Feng (Cinnamon Lakeside)
excerpt: Long Feng has good service, but the food just doesn't push it far enough. It's fairly average Chinese, and within this hotel it should be more.
yamu_review: ["Long Feng is the Chinese restaurant at Cinnamon Lakeside. Their prices are reasonable, and their service is good, but the food just isn't spectacular. We had a rather mediocre meal when we visited for dinner.\xa0", "The staff at the restaurant are very prompt, well-mannered and know the menu, which is good. They'll advise you against dishes\xa0even. Ambiance wise the place is fairly well lit, with some minimalist paintings on the wall and ceramics on display. It is by no means a romantic setting, unless you sit outside. It's a pretty sterile place so you could take your family there.", "We decided to order the signature dishes off the menu, which led us to Fried Prawns With Wasabi Mayo (Rs 350) for starters. The presentation was honestly quite hideous. Taste wise, the wasabi was very subtle, with a bit of the flavour coming through and none of the heat. The batter wasn't crisp, which was disappointing.\xa0", "For our mains, we got the Steamed Garoupa Hunan Style (Rs 1530) and it was pretty damn good. At the price it's worthwhile and it's got just enough heat to please a Sri Lankan palate. The flesh wasn't overcooked, and I liked how the jaw looked propped open.\xa0", "The Singapore Style Noodles (Rs 600) were disappointing, though, and we're not sure why they're marked as a signature dish. The chicken was super dry. I guess I should just stop ordering this and always ask for a flat noodle since that's what I prefer. They give you a decent portion just enough for two.", "They had some creative cocktails going on in the drinks options so we tried one called\xa0Peachy (Rs 590) and it tastes super syrupy to the point that it was kind of off-putting. It's got that saccharine sweetness that has no depth of flavour. Go with table water. Oh, and they don't serve the table water with strawberries inside anymore.", 'Our dessert, the Lychee Ice Cream Cake (Rs 450) was pretty good, despite being an ice cream cake that barely tasted like lychee, save for the base and top.\xa0', "We think this restaurant, being inside\xa0Cinnamon Lakeside, could do way better than it has been. There's just a sheer lack of excitement on looking at their menu, and it's not helped at all by the standard fare that's plated. Sri Lankans love their Chinese food, so there's no excuse for neglecting it, really.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Long Feng is the Chinese restaurant at Cinnamon Lakeside.

It was so bad I could not believe a 5-star hotel would give such bad food.  I ordered chicken fried-rice and a chicken dish (chicken and cashew nut).  The fried rice was simply tasteless. The chicken pieces were just boiled chicken shredded.  The chicken dish was terrible. The boneless chicken pieces were just too big and also had a very odd texture and was visually very unappealing. It was not tasty. It was so bad, I had to get rid of the chicken pieces and eat only the cashew nut and vegetables.   I think just like everything else in this country, the hotels have also gone down very badly in quality. I am  kind of not surprised, because when everything sucks in Colombo, the so-called 5* hotels cannot escape that can u. I read somewhere that some of the 5* hotels in Colombo do not have a proper license from the CMC. This one could be one of those.   I have decided not to patronize any of these places in the future. Even if you go due to circumstances beyond your control, better order only 1 or 2 dishes. Otherwise you will definitely be ripped off. Sure about that.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    what do you expect from a country with so many taxes on every food imports. high tax means low food quality.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    high tax on imported goods means limited items you can eat or buy. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    You need to eat their pork ribs, pork belly stew, gangbao potatoes/chicken and the killer citrus chicken.
