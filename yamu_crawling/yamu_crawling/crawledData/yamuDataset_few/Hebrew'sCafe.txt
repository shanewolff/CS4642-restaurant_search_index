yamu_review: ["The newly opened Hebrew's Cafe rests in a shady nook down 5th lane in Rajagiriya. They serve breakfast all day, their sandwiches are filling\xa0and the premises are beautifully decorated.\xa0", 'Our mains comprised of a Spicy Grilled Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese Panini (Rs. 600) and a portion of the Eggs Benedict (Rs. 650).', "Two full chicken fillets sandwiched between perfectly toasted ciabatta bread, dripping with cheese for Rs. 600 is a fair purchase. The chicken was tender, incredibly juicy and spilled out the sides\xa0through its bready enclosure which meant you get to chew on a big chunk of chicken with every bite. It's served with a fresh romaine lettuce and tomato salad with olive oil dressing alongside a portion of crisp fries. The only drawback here was that the spice didn't come through, but it doesn't matter. This one's a winner.\xa0", "The eggs benny was presented humbly atop two slices of bacon on what appeared to be burger buns. It's a bit of a step-down from English muffins, but few restaurants here actually serve them. The eggs were well done with a splendidly runny yolk, peppered with chilli powder and garnished with cilantro. Vishwi said the bacon was oozing with flavour and did a good job of tying the whole thing together.", "We got ourselves a Cappuccino (Rs. 390) and a Latte (Rs. 400). The coffee\xa0used is Italian sourced, pre-roasted and wasn't too shabby.", "The Cappuccino came in a large, flat cup and I found the coffee art hilarious. Most high-end places don't really bother so I found this a thoughtful touch. Reminded me of a winking Bacchus.", '\r\nTaste-wise it came off rather flat. The foam to milk ratio was fine although the milk was stronger than the coffee.', '\r\n', "We initially placed an order for an iced latte but they served us the hot counterpart instead. The latte art didn't pop like the cappuccino but whatever. This was a taller mug though so getting through the warm coffee was a bit of a task thanks to the sweltering heat. It tasted very similar to the cappuccino so nothing special to report here.", '\r\nI recommend you stick to their juices.', "Their light yellow and blue\xa0colour scheme screams positive vibes. With a lot of wooden furniture and tons of decor along the walls it's basically a peppy environment I can see becoming popular with the kids from the neighbouring schools. Also they've paid great attention to detail like this little spot here.", "It's a very Instagrammable location so make sure your battery's charged and you have enough space on your SD cards.", "\r\nIt can get unbearably hot inside despite there being a lot of ventilation, but the heat's to blame. They have fans in full rotation but this didn't help. We were told that they'll have A/Cs up and running very soon so that'll be more comfy.", '\r\nService is excellent. We were offered cold water and we noticed the staff going about checking on customers regularly.', "Hebrew's seems very very promising and I hope they don't falter in terms of quality. I definitely see myself going back and I recommend this place if you're in the area and are looking for a brunch feast or to grab a bite.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Hebrew's Cafe is Rajagiriya's newest entrant into the coffee-shop scene and being from the hood I decided to check them out.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    තමන්ගේ පාඩුවේ පොතක් පතක් කියවන ගමන්, කෝපි උගුරක් තොල ගාලා පනීනි එකක් කන්න නියම තැනක් තමයි මේ හීබෘව්ස් කැෆේ එක. \n                                                                                                                            ']

It was all very good. I'm a coffee aficionado and the arabica coffee they seem to serve here was fresh and had no bitter taste as mentioned in above reviews. Maybe that's because I came here at 8:30am for breakfast and they used new filters. It's a quiet, welcoming place with lots of fresh air and light, you can talk without having to scream above the music and the food was tasty, fresh and value for money. What more do you really need in a neighborhood cafe?\n                                    ", "\n                                            This is only about the coffee. I haven't had any food yet so can't really give my judgement there but the coffee was oh so bad. We went with our standard orders of Americanos and they had a really unpleasant burnt smell and they tasted just like how they smelled. Acrid. My companion compared it to McDonald's coffee and I was inclined to agree. He actually threw away half of the cup. Combined with the unusually slow service, I'm not sure if I'd visit them again.\n                                    "]
