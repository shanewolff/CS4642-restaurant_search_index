name: R & R Beach Restaurant
excerpt: At the end of Marine drive its a little fenced off patch of land with seating out doors and a small covered structure for cooking between the train tracks and the sea. There are tables just two feet from the ocean and the food is simple but good and reasonably inexpensive. Prawn fried rice with hot butter cuttle fish and lashings of their chili paste comes to less than Rs. 1000/=.

Awesome place to have a party. Convenient place since it's @ marine drive\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Had lunch here - nice and chilled out - also a bit deserted. Food was piping hot and good except it was perhaps drowning in sauce (we ordered the chopsuey rice and devilled cuttlefish)\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Went there last week at about 3.30pm, they arranged a table just near the shore. Atmosphere is quite good and relax. Service was good and friendly. No corkage. Served fast and fresh sea food. Only sea food varieties available. They charged Rs.650/- for any type of sea food plate - but the portion is reasonable for that price. We had 1L Smirnoff with just 2 seafood plates.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I saw a fish fly in three leaps off a rock a wave had rudely deposited it on, as I forked into a cube of fried thalapath (blue marlin) simply dressed with crescents of onions, cucumber and tomato. Sitting by a table overlooking the sea, we also ordered a plate of fried noodles. There wasn't much in drinks to chose from (other than Atlanta's secret brown piss) but instead ordered hot water received in very clean glasses, which we toasted ourselves with. The waiter was a handsome young man of few words in English, but who gave us what we wanted in short order. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal, eating every squiggle of lightly fried noodles chaperoned by diced carrot, scallion, etc. It was a sunless cool day by the seaside at Ramakrishna Road, Dehiwela, great for several subtleties of grey cloud and red train watching; watching especially far away the sea salt eat uselessly into the orange gantries of a port project stalled by the sheer stupidity of Colombo's colonials who long for P&O to retain English control of our seaways. Still we had a great lunch quiet except for two young boys and a girl sweetly taking selfies, the swish and swash of the tides, and occasional crescendo of the SLGR that drowned it all. Assuming that this was not a flash in the pan, we'd recommend Lani's for a slow luncheon siesta by the ocean. A sunset dinner promises to be even better. Let's see next time.
