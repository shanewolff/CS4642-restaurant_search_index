", "\r\nSkewers of wings, tail, gizzard, corn and mince balls were great but the chicken leg & Prawn were so-so. Sadly the Hatsu was not available to try… If in a group, recommend the garlic rice (off the main menu, so not part of the deal), which is fantastic but a little dear at nearly LKR 900, considering it's only rice…Order wisely, and one can go home happy.

I ordered the fried tofu whilst my friends were going crazy as to which raw delicacy they should order first. I LOVED the tofu dish, but the serving was rather small, so I ordered another serving. That set me back by about 1200 rupees which was a bit too pricey for my liking. Then again, I've heard that Nihonbashi is quite expensive. I wouldn't have minded spending that much of money if I got a bit more tofu per serving. I got about 5-6 small pieces of tofu in a tiny bowl with a little bit of sauce. I then ordered some veggie sticks, which came with a side of mayonnaise and a raisin-y sauce. That was delicious too.", '\r\n', '\r\nI was very happy with the service.

The menu was very deceiving and not worth the money spent. . We came in hungry and left hungry after spending 8k for 2 people.  . Food took more than an hour to be served. .will not recommend to anyone. . Ridiculous is too good a word! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    An absolute ripoff!!! Went for dinner at Nihonbashi tonight and just got home and I am so angry (and hungry) im bothering to post a comment right now! First off i bought the green tea which smelled like raw fish and tasted disgusting and when we requested them to change it it still smelled the same we didn't even bother to try it! Alright alright just one hitch let's not ruin our night is what we thought! We then ordered the dumplings which were pretty good but that being an entree took exactly 40 minutes to reach the table! Thank god for good company we didnt really feel the time go by. And then sadly i decided to try out the chanpon ramen! A supposedly shio (salt) based soup with a generous serving of crunchy vegetables and pork.  Its safe to say it was the worst dish I've ever tried. It was just maggi noodles in a broth with a boiled egg cut in half and a lot of leeks! U had to swim in it to find a piece of pork! I stopped at two spoonfuls coz why get fat over bull like this? I just wanted to get out of there! And once I complained to the waiter there were only 2 pieces of pork ( and when I mean two pieces of pork i mean two shredded tiny pieces of pork) he goes back to check if the dish is actually supposed to have pork and once he confirms it does he has the guts to tell me the dish only comes with two shredded pieces of pork. Really? You should have put that on the menu when I decided to buy this worthless dish of crap for 1890 rupees with an extra 1000 ruppee service charge!!!\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Nihonbashi is a rip off, they serve mediocore food and charge exorbitant prices\n                                            ']
