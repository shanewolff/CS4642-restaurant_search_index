After reading the name and seeing the picture on their board, we figured it would come with something like kidney beans or baked beans.  What came in it was RICE! Plain white rice with some tomato and salad leaves in a wrap. It was horrible and neither of us could finish even half of it. I can't remember the price but it was quite expensive  for what we got. Mushroom and cheese sandwich was better but I could not finish it as it was oyster mushrooms with not much flavour it it.  Not going there again. \n                                            "]
