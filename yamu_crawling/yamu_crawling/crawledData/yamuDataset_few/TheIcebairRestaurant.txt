name: The Icebair Restaurant
excerpt: Icebair is a small, underrated, Swiss-owned outlet in Negombo with a great, rustic atmosphere.
yamu_review: ["The Icebair Restaurant is an understated little place that\xa0you can easily miss because it's part of the Icebear guesthouse. It's quirky and somewhat eccentric —\xa0a comfortable combination of weird and chilled out.", 'They have a decent menu covering "Swiss food, authentic, nowhere else in the island to find", vegetarian dishes, "Sweeties, Dessert Parade", seafood, muesli, and "Tea & Coffee, stylish celebrated in silver, with a biscuit" (we didn\'t receive the biscuit. WHY).', 'I\'m starting off with the ambience here because that\'s what drew us in. We stumbled across this place by accident while\xa0walking past. The lush greenery and crazy paving stoked\xa0my curiousity, though I wasn\'t exactly sure what it was when I\xa0first walked in. I think I missed the initial signboard that\xa0said "Icebear Guesthouse" (the restaurant is a little building separate\xa0from the guesthouse, within\xa0the same property), and instead walked into the\xa0Icebair Restaurant. (Yes, they spell Icebear [guesthouse] and Icebair [restaurant] differently).', "There are\xa0a few tables and chairs laid out under the portico/ in the verandah, as you can see, but there's also some\xa0wrought iron furniture scattered around, a couple of hammocks slung across coconut trees, and a line of pool chairs facing the beach.", "It's all very chilled out, and we liked it. They had\xa0decorated the place in the most rustic way, with old seashells and stuff arranged around the area.", 'They also have a little lending library in an old cupboard, so if you want to read while sipping on your coffee or enjoying a glass of milkwine, this place is for you.', 'While the general enthusiasm of the menu will make you eager to try it, it will also leave you in stitches.\xa0The top of the menu card says that it\'s where \'East meets West, The Icebair Restaurant with Swissness\'. They have Bottled Coca Cola ("Forbid, not Pepsi!") and stuff like Inspected Table Water, and muesli with \'eatable\' hibiscus flowers. Their breakfasts and mains are from Rs. 600 upwards, with most of the dishes costing closer to Rs. 1,000.', "However, their drinks and desserts are below Rs. 500, and that's what we went for.", "We ordered a\xa0Caffè all'italiana (Rs. 390) which was accompanied by a side of milk and sugar in little bronze jugs. The coffee was dark, not too thick, and slightly bitter, as it should be.", "Next up was their Spicy Ceylon Milkwine on the rocks (Rs. 320). It was described as 'a fine, exciting apertif, crystal-clear'. It wasn't exactly crystal clear, but it did have an amber glow to it, and looked like pure happiness.", 'My friend — a Negombo local —\xa0said that it was the best milk wine she had\xa0tasted, and that it was "milky, and not too strong". Given that she\'s tasted a lot of the stuff, and that people in Negombo apparently make their own milk wine, I\'m taking her word for it.\xa0Next up was the homemade Ceylon Cinnamon Ice\xa0Cream, which was priced at Rs. 420. Although the cinnamon flavour didn\'t come through strongly, it was definitely there. The ice cream was a tad too sweet\xa0but the cinnamon sort of balanced the sweetness out — it was like having a spiced ice-cream. It was also very creamy and quick to melt, but then again, it was a really hot day as well.', "The staff are friendly and they don't bother you by hovering around. This has its pros and cons,\xa0because after taking your order and placing the food around, they tend to disappear. You can find them if you walk over to the reception though, and they appear instantly after that.\xa0", "The Icebair Restaurant has some interesting albeit pricey stuff, but their desserts and drinks are reasonably priced. It's a great place to spend a quiet evening out, and you can be assured of peace and quiet. Go there if you want to have some much-needed alone time."]
