excerpt: A great spot for authentic Sri Lankan cuisine.
yamu_review: ["Karapincha is\xa0on Galle Road, adjoining the Concord Grand Hotel. It has a huge green sign on top, so you won't miss it.\xa0", 'The menu is pretty interesting, with a wide range of authentic Sri Lankan cuisine to choose from, and relatively reasonable prices.', 'We got a portion of ', ' (Tempered Yellow\xa0Rice - Rs. 200), ', " (Tempered Cashew cooked in Coconut Milk - Rs. 429) and the Chef's special ", '\xa0(Chicken Black Curry with Fried Rice - Rs. 523) and a ', ' (Egg Salad - Rs. 132).', "The\xa0rice portions were cooked perfectly with strong spices like karapincha\xa0(of course), cinnamon and cloves to bring out that perfect rice aroma. I can't tell you enough how much I\xa0love a good cashew curry and this was oh so delicious! The gravy was so creamy and the cashews were soft and easy to bite into.", 'The chicken was nothing special but slightly on the\xa0pricier side for a small portion but the gravy was seasoned well and full of flavour. It was just the right amount of spiciness we were looking for.\xa0The egg salad was a great addition with fresh veggies and boiled eggs.', 'For dessert, we got a Cream Caramel (Rs. 200). While the presentation was a bit unpleasant,\xa0the texture was everything you would want in a caramel pudding; soft and creamy with the typical sweet and milky flavour.', 'We tried a Watermelon Juice (Rs. 209) and a Hot Ginger\xa0Tea (Rs. 110) which were both superb. The watermelon thankfully had very little sugar in addition to its natural sweetness. The tea was surprisingly good and had a slight ginger flavour. It was a proper homemade tea that you could have without sugar and\xa0would still taste good.\xa0', 'Service was quick. Our food arrived within 10-15 minutes. The staff was friendly and courteous which is always refreshing to see.\xa0', 'They have done a decent job in terms of design but it could be improved. Nevertheless, there\xa0was ample space for large or small groups amidst wooden tables and\xa0chairs with nicely colour coordinated\xa0cutlery and tableware.\xa0', 'It was a quality experience. The food was delicious and tasted homemade with very little additives. Our total bill came to around Rs. 2400 including service charges and taxes which was very reasonable considering the flavour, texture and the portion sizes.\xa0', "We highly recommend you try this place. It's", ' as well cause they prepare your food pretty fast.\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Delicious and authentic Sri Lankan food.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    අපේ ඔරිජිනල් රසට බතක් කන්න ඕනේ නම්, ඔන්න තවත් තැනක්. \n                                                                                                                            ']
