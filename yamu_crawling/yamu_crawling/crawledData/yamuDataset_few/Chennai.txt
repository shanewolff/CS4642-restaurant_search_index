excerpt: Ever been to one of those places where you ate so much, you had to just stop and rest a bit? Those kind of places are harder to come by now since food in general is too expensive, but at long last we found another in Chennai restaurant. You can pretty much stuff your face full of tasty Indian dishes and it'll cost you less than Rs.400, guaranteed.

Tried their Spicy gee dosai, parata, vadei and fruit juices. They did not allow us to go upstairs. So no AC at all. There weren't any staff in a uniform. The cashier himself came to get the orders. He was helpful in selecting the items. The food actually tasted good. But once you were done eating, nobody comes to clean the tables or anything. Apparently they don't give a shit about whether you even want to order more food. We ordered fruit juices and it took nearly 45 minutes for the juices to arrive. And then to pay the bill, we nearly had to wait like 20 minutes standing infront of the cashier until he finished his personal telephone calls.

I would suggest you take away and enjoy the meal. :)\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Ate here recently and found the food very tasty and cheap.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Nothing much very ordinary, Service is poor \n                                            ']
