yamu_review: ["Colombo doesn't have many theme restaurants, but The Sizzle is an exception. They're definitely pricey but the food is good, the service is excellent and the theme is right on point.", "The catch here is that everything sizzles, and by that we mean everything whether it be food, dessert or even the drinks. The latter of which is achieved by adding a bit of dry ice. The prices can be quite steep though, so expect to pay anywhere between Rs. 1500 - Rs. 2500 per head, depending on what dishes you choose. While that may be the case, the people don't seem to mind paying a bit more for an interesting experience, since the place was packed to capacity even during the lunch service. The menu is quite extensive with a good selection of seafood and pretty much all the usual meats, sans pork. Most of the dishes are named after international boxers for some reason, which can be a bit annoying since it's pretty ambiguous.", "For starters we tried out the sizzling chicken cubes (Rs. 650), which was actually very tasty. It comes with the decent portion of tender chicken cubes and french fries, topped with thick pepper sauce. At Rs. 650 it costs as much as a regular dish at other places, but all things considered we'd say it's pretty good.", 'The knockout sizzler (Rs. 1450) is a fillet of grilled modha topped with baby corn, mushrooms, cheese and fresh cream. You can choose from a selection of sauces and carbs to go with this. The hero of this dish was the modha fillet which was perfectly cooked and worked quite nicely with the mushrooms and white sauce. The downside was that the sides were very ordinary with the baby corn, peas and boiled potatoes all tasting a bit bland.', "For a slightly budget friendly option we ordered the Mongolian fried rice with beef (Rs. 950). One thing to keep in mind here is that the rice dishes are enough for two. This one was okay, but definitely not the best Mongolian we've had. The good thing though is that they give you plenty of beef which on it's own tastes pretty good. ", "We were pretty stuffed after the mains but we decided to try out their Philadelphia strawberry cheesecake (Rs. 700), and boy oh boy, were we ever glad we did. This was easily the best take on a cheesecake that I've had in a while. It's slightly thicker than usual, but the flavour was perfect. The fact that it's served sizzling makes it that much better, with the warm strawberry sauce and cool ice cream adding a beautiful contrast of temperatures.", "We'd say The Sizzle is a middle class restaurant, in the sense that it falls in the mid range between fine dining restaurants and cafe types, along with the likes of ", '. The interior is dominated by an orange and black theme which works fine. One weird and interesting feature is their ceiling which is entirely made decorated with small portraits of customers.', "Service is one area where they really excel at. The staff was attentive, courteous and efficient, with the food coming to the table in about 15 minutes, during a very crowded service. We questioned them quite a bit about the dishes before we ordered and they were very helpful and knowledgeable. It's a young and energetic bunch that seem to enjoy what they do, which makes a pretty big difference. All of it making for a very pleasant experience.", 'The Sizzle offers a truly one-of-a-kind experience with their theme. The prices are pretty high, but the food is quite good and the service is exceptional. Definitely worth a visit.', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Colombo doesn't have many theme restaurants, but The Sizzle is an exception.
