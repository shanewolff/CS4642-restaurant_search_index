name: Wonderland
excerpt: Wonderland is an ice cream and smoothie joint in Malabe that has a huge range of stuff on their menu, and it's quite cheap too. Their smoothie glasses are tall and they've got cool flavours like Milo and bubblegum. It is all the way in Malabe though, so all you people in central Colombo, suck it up.
