On my visit I came upon Kumudu and Jayaratne, two extremely jovial individuals at the rambutan end of the street. Jayaratne demanded I take a photograph of him and Kumudu started pimping out the other fruits on the stretch as well – would I like some durian?', 'Hell no. ‘Gandhai!’ I told him. Harima gandhai (no offense to durian lovers, it’s an acquired taste I guess, an acquired taste for stinky old clothes… oh and fun fact, this stuff is apparently an aphrodisiac, what!). He disagreed, but happily indulged my request for a bunch of mangosteens.', 'Prices for Rambutan are around Rs. 10 per fruit.', 'Havelock Road’s Laurel and Hardy were such fun to hang out with – they cracked jokes about each other’s photo-poses, Jayaratne’s pride was hurt when I called him ‘uncle’ and they mumbled ‘boru’ when I told them I was Sri Lankan just to get a reaction out of me (which they did).', 'The rambutans were medium-sized and very red and tasty – they should be getting bigger and better in July, said Jayaratne – but the mangosteens were way juicier. So head out there at the end of this month for the best ones, and bag some before the season ends in August.']
