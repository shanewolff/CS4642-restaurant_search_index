yamu_review: ['Streat360 is a beautiful and rustic resto down Ward Place with a mixture of Sri Lankan, Mexican, Western and Vietnamese dishes. Their concept is\xa0street food from around the world. Rather expensively dished up street food, if I may add.', "The waitstaff are friendly and helpful and they know their menu, which is great. We saw some Chicharones (Rs. 530) as a 'lite bite' and thought it would be fun to try out because it's well, chicken. It's technically chicken skin, but for some weird reason I didn't expect it to be ", ' that (and it was) so woopsy; my bad. This was crackly, crispy, intensely oily chicken skin.', "This might be an acquired taste, but it really didn't go down well. No one back at worked liked it either, and we were icked out by it.", 'Our mains were an incredibly expensive Mutton Biryani (Rs. 1500) and a Piri Piri Chicken (Rs.1400).', 'The biryani was actually quite lovely, with flavoursome and fatty bits of mutton in it and fragrant long rice. It was pretty nice, but definitely priced on the higher end of the spectrum.', 'The chicken was well done and quite plentiful in quantity, but taste-wise was just alright. It was spicy and packed a bit of heat, and was accompanied by a side of wedges and a pretty great salad. The salad > chicken. Which is really weird.', 'Despite our rather disappointing experience with the food, we really really enjoyed our drinks.', "Behold our Passion Fruit Virgin Mojito (Rs. 400) and Lemongrass and Mint (Rs. 300). The drinks were spot on with the Passion Fruit having\xa0perfect acidity and sweetness, and the lemongrass a predominant and interesting flavour. The latter was garnished with a stalk of lemongrass as well, so that added a lot more authenticity to it. FYI, they don't have a liquor licence, so they're generally chill with you bringing in your own bottle of wine etc.\xa0", 'Long solid benches and desks akin to ones on the streets as well as your regular old tables and chairs provides furnishing. ', "There are a few cool paintings around, the decor is minimalistic and beautiful, and the whole place is really well lit thanks to a couple of walls being mostly glass. It's a very lovely spot, inclusive of an outdoor seating area.", "Streat360 is a cool place to hang out because of the funky decor, but personally, the food is hella overpriced for the quality and quantity. The drinks are really good though, so that's something worth checking out.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Streat360 is a beautiful and rustic resto down Ward Place with a mixture of Sri Lankan, Mexican, Western and Vietnamese dishes.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Streat360 is an interesting little restaurant featuring 'street food' from different countries.

Not here. 850 for a hotdog means it should be exceptional. Stardogs hot dog is so much better and bigger with better flavor and value for money. Food wasnt hot, bun wasnt crispy,sausage was hard plus not even sauce is put.750 for hotbatter cuttlefish means its a proper dish. Not expecting some fried onions and leeks with few cuttlefish pieces which was not crispy at all. For 750 you can have the most amazing cuttle fish dish at sea food cove mount lavinia and the best of all is at arthurs pizza mount.For Bangers and mash, keels sausage is much better than sausage given here which was not done properly at all with 'not' mashed potatoes. To top it off, received a fries pack which includes nothing less than a pack of fries you get on super market which was also fried in two,three batches so it includes, half fried,medium fried,burnt fries which was horrible. Try burger king fries or even fries at malay joint burgers king is much better than here. for a price tag of 3600 i would have had something so much better at any other place except here.
