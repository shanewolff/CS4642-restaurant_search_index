Most of the time  they don't go well. And it's hard for me to make them present for these meetings. Once I took a box of Délicieux cupcakes and they loved it. Now they are regularly present and likes the idea. We love your cupcakes. Keep up the good work.\n                                    ", '\n                                            I\'ve been to many bakeries in the past few years and taken pleasure in tasting many types of cakes/desserts but non have come even remotely close to the experience I had with "Dèlicieux". The red velvet brownie is undoubtedly my favourite amongst the variety of Dèlicieux  baked goodies. And it is unbelievable that they\'re all vegan cause they\'re no different to a traditionally baked cake in terms of taste/flavour. Try it sometime, it\'s a gastronomic delight!\n                                    ']

Well I have tried few of their products and am not satisfied with the quality. Well the base is soft and fudgy. But the icing is really sweet. the baker might have to think about reducing the sugar level. Also the alcoholic range does not feel like it has alcohol in it . With the Vegan products i think baker has to reduce the amount of oil being used. Cause its most of the time really oily and sticky. These are not to offend the baker but just suggestions. Overall Delicieux need some lifting.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Thank you foodie for your feedback. I'm sorry you weren't too happy with your taste of delicieux. The sweetness depends on the customers preference.  Delicieux takes pride on the fact that our orders are customised to suite the customer…  so if you prefer your sweets less in sugar just let us know when you place the order :) we have to say the same about the alcohol level.  We usually stick to enough alcohol to add flavour bit on request you can go up to one entire bottle of alcohol of your choice. With the launch of our guilt free range we have cut down on the quantity of oil and sweetness…  Maybe it's worth checking out :) it maybe more up ur street :) thanx again for the feedback and we are always looking at ways to improve. Have a great day!\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Also reference to the above article we are located in borella.
