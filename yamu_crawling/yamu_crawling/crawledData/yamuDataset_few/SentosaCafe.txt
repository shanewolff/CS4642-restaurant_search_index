excerpt: Sentosa is a Singaporean restaurant which seems to focus more on Malaysian fare, but also serves In
yamu_review: ["Set atop Grand Gourmet, Sentosa Cafe is perched right next to Stamford Bar and completes this\xa0trilogy that combines weird bar scenes, French fine dining, and Singaporean cuisine. We know this sounds strange, but that's just what it is; three different restaurants/ a bar under the same compact building, run by the same management.", "Despite this, the food at Sentosa is unexpectedly good, they even have a Malaysian chef. (Yes, for a Singaporean restaurant, half the dishes were Indonesian and Malaysian. As Imaad pointed out, they're more Pan-Asian than purely Singaporean).", "For starters, we went for an Nyonya Mango Salad (Rs. 450) which was hands down one of the best salads we've had.\xa0", 'A bit like\xa0', "\xa0if I'm to compare it to anything we're familiar with, this had thinly sliced raw mangoes mixed with other thinly sliced and commonly found greens, including\xa0", ". Throw in a bit of dried and fried sprats, plenty of lime squeezed in,\xa0mix it up nicely and you're done. We were both\xa0surprised at how well this was executed given that most salads we've come across here are boring affairs. Add to that, everything was super fresh, so that was pretty amazing as well.", "For mains, we went for the Laksa Noodles (Rs. 760) and the Malaysian Beef Rendang (Rs. 880), both which were generous portions large enough to bring the left overs back to office. With rice noodles swimming in a bowl of spiced and fragrant coconut milk, I was surprised at how well the chicken, tofu, and shrimps blended well together. The taste of lemon grass could have been\xa0stronger, but we still enjoyed the dish. The spices came out nicely, so we recommend this. However, if you're expecting the typical rice noodles which usually accompanies a Laksa, you won't get that because the noodle here is a bit denser.", 'Their beef rendang comes with a bowl of steaming rice, and enough beef to feed about three hungry adults.', "Whilst this definitely packed in flavour and punch which we don't get in most of our local beef dishes, the meat itself didn't\xa0fall apart too easily and was of a much chewier texture than what\xa0slow-cooked beef should ideally be. The best rendang we've had to date is at ", ' at the Good Market.', "Moving onto dessert, we tried their Mango Mousse with Coconut Honey (Rs. 490), which was fabulous. They've somehow managed to get an authentic ", ' flavour going on, and the tartness of the mango flavour went really well with the sweetened cream.', 'Service is super friendly, and the steward we got went beyond his duty to find out how the mousse was made (because I was curious), and to introduce their new chef to us.', "Ambience-wise, the dining area is a splash of reds and oranges, and fin-like motifs on the walls. There's also some purple going on; the colour scheme is rather confusing and garish.", "It's spacious\xa0(or it seemed so because we were literally the only diners there), and could perhaps seat about 25\xa0people comfortably. One really weird factor is that this is a family restaurant, but it opens up into the ", " As in, when one of our friends visited the bar earlier in the month they heard kids running around and having fun at Sentosa, and had a random kid (or two) wander into the bar as well. So we're\xa0not sure how the ambience is at night.", "Sentosa's got some really decent food, and their chef seems to be doing a good job. When speaking to us, he mentioned that the restaurant had a few complaints regarding the food when they started up, but that was when they had local chefs making a mess of the food. So he's come down from Indonesia and is currently revamping the menu and training the local chefs on how to make authentic Singaporean/ Indonesian/ Malaysian cuisine.", "\nFrom what we sampled, they've got their food game going strong.", '\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Pan-Asian cuisine, good food, friendly service.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    මේක සිංගප්පූරු කීවට ඇත්තට ම මෙනු එකෙන් බාගයක් විතර ඉන්දුනීසියන්, මැලේසියන් කෑම. සිංගප්පූරු කෑම කඩයකට වඩා ඒෂියන් කෑම කඩයක් කිව්වොත් හරි\n                                                                                                                            ']

Last month the paint had just dried and we were the only  people who were there for lunch. Really interesting menu. Don't know how many times I have to come to try it all. Unfortunately the waiter changed my order of tamarind beef for rendang beef (which was really tender cooked). We ate a bit too much. We drank only water but the bill came to 5000 rs anyway (starter, fried rice, 3 or 4 dishes, i forgot). You missed an important asset: at the side of the restaurant(complex) there is a lot of parking space. Another thing of interest: both restaurants are owned by the Sri Lankan member of the British parlement. His French gourmet restaurant looked totally empty at lunchtime as well.

You ask to substitute a chicken satay for the beef satay  in a dish where you only get 2 satays, the chef will only give you one chicken satay and the management will back the chef and charged us for two satays.

The rest of the points deductions are due to the exceptional management personal.

Strange to me that the owner is not willing to pay a better salary and employ a good chef.

I had an Indonesian Fried Rice (Nasi Goreng) and my friend had a Singapore Chicken rice. We also got a portion of stir fried beef.  The Nasi Goreng was simply amazing. It was so authentic and tasty unlike some of the typical stuff we get in most of the restaurants in Colombo. I tasted my friend's Chicken Rice too and it wasn't second to Nasi Goreng. I could just eat the rice with the soy sauce that came with it. The chicken was just cooked to perfection.  Not to forget the Stir fried beef which again was seriously good.

It was quite pickeled like an achcharu as the reviewer has listed. Got a spicy Singapore crab and had quite good succulent crab. Was on the sweet side over the spicy side but potion size and gravy was good with the rice. Beef rendeng was dry coconut rich curry and it was really tender. It's how it supposed to be good rich coconut taste. Definitely goes down well with the hot steaming rice. The customer care was excellent for us and the manager actually took off the salad as we had to wait for rice. Im not sure it's a mistake but their orange juice was priced at Rs 720!

I went for lunch with a friend and ordered 3 main course dishes to share (Hainanese Chicken Rice, Nasi Goreng, and Laksa) The quantities were large and sadly the praise ends there. First of all we asked for 2 filter waters to which we were told no to and that if we wanted to drink water we would have to buy it… Not providing free filtered water which costs nothing is a big no no! The food was average at best, with the biggest let down being the chicken rice which was extremly dry and was basically a pice of roast chicken with some rice that vaguely tasted like it was cooked in broth. For the two of us lunch with no alcohol came to LKR3,500 which we felt was a bit pricy. The decor and colour scheme would give the strongest of stomachs a sudden urge to vomit.
