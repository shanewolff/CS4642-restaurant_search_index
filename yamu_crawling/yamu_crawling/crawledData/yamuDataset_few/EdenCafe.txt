I regret ever going there!  the place is Big and the entrance lobby is sleek and posh, but the dining area doesn't keep up with it. they just don't know what they are. instead of investing on the premises, they should have invested on a good cook and supply. I hope they get better direction in the future- should take up acropol as a case study.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Such a waste of a nice place, if only the food was half as good as the location I would keep going, but Eden falls way short on that aspect, I don't know how to to explain this but the food and staff seems to be robotic (i.e. lacking human touch?)\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    While going through your site looking for a place to dine I went through your review.Do you consider Subs and Burger as Healthy food.You order for subs and burger and whatever that stuffed thing is called healthy or fine dining food.I think I should try Eden Cafe food on my next visit to Sri Lanka\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I am a chef myself.I just came across this blog which is very informative.But, I was very surprised to see this review.I frequented this Restaurant regularly while staying at Hotel Euro lanka which is two doors away while vacationing in sri-lanka.  The entrance lobby is classy and so was the interior tastefully done compared to most restaurants i visited in colombo. It seemed like a good place to relax, unwind and also dine. I was very impressed with the service they offered as well as the range of food. ', '\r\nThe food was delicious and i loved their Chinese cuisine.I also loved the cheesy burgers and submarines they offered and so did my friends.i agree with whats said above You cant expect fast-food to be healthy food.The best part was that they has a great Sheesha lounge out-doors, and it was truly gratifying to have Sheesha there in the nights after Relaxing and dining at the restaurant inside.Thumbs up to Eden Cafe! I will be vising there again.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    i just love the place … feels so comfy.love the food and sheesha speacialy the portello float milk shake  is a killer…\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Actually it was nice!!

Don't know whether only the executive lunch was horrible or all other food was the same. The Fried rice was bland and so was the pasta. Devilled chicken had no salt in it. Few desserts yet again horrible. Cake was hard and really dry had some kind of pudding I almost puked after eating it. But ambiance and the tasteful decoration is just awesome, no words to describe.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Look at the cake and food photos and I doubt I will eat it. Situated in such a good location and beautiful structure…what a bad decision to sell fast food, there are far too many along Marine Drive. Change it to a proper restaurant and the chances of success are higher. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I hope the Eden Cafe management read this….the taste is of the of food is ok, bu the quantity of the food is far below expectation…take dinemore or pilawoos they provide value for money…eden cafe is in the fast food sector and should take a cue to the other sucessful player…srilankan want their tummy filled……\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I do not recommend any one. The food was horrible. My sister fell sick after having food from Eden cafe. \n                                            ']
