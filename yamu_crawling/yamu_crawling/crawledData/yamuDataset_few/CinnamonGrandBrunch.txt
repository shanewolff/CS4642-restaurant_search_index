name: Cinnamon Grand Brunch
excerpt: Whether you're just visiting Colombo or you live here, the Cinnamon Grand Brunch is a must visit. This lavish Sunday luncheon has long been a tradition with many Colombo families who, after church or a Sunday lie in, drive over to spend their afternoon ensconced in the Taprobane restaurant amidst cascading chocolate fountains, silver platters of oysters and glistening legs of lamb.

They recently re-opened after refurbishment and the place is so over booked they usually seat some at the adjoining London Grill. I particularly recommend the turkey and apple lasagne, the carvery meats and very extensive salad bar.
