excerpt: Ginger's a small Bistro that offers a mix of Asian Flavours. They've got a cozy space with some nice curry dishes, but are also quite pricey.
yamu_review: ["Ginger is a chic little restaurant nestled next to Jagro in Dharmapala Mawatha. It's multi-cuisine and has a menu comprising of sandwiches, pastas, soups and salads. They also play acoustic music on Tuesdays.", "We dropped by on a sunny Thursday afternoon, and found the white and ochre theme quite refreshing. It's minimalistic, and they've utilised the space they have well, without making it feel overcrowded or stuffy.", 'The acoustics of the place are\xa0weird though — sound reverberates a\xa0', ", so the thrum of the blender, the playlist they had going, and people's voices just kept echoing and escalating. Kavindu and I found the music very distracting because of how you could only hear the bass and not much of anything else. Noise aside, the space is great.\xa0", "They've also got a couple of outdoor options, the deck right in front and then a more secluded area in the back, strung up with little bulbs; so I assume it'd look lovely at night.", 'A server came over and helped us over to our seats from the second we stepped in, followed shortly by the menu. I wish this was an indication of how prompt their service is, but unfortunately it turned out quite slow: we ordered at 1:40 and got soup twenty minutes later with the mains eventually making their way over\xa020 minutes after even that. We basically ended up waiting about 40 minutes, such sadness.', 'Thankfully we got our drinks relatively early, and Kavindu loved his Pineapple juice (Rs. 350). My Passion Punch (Rs. 450) was a passionfruit incarnate, sourness and all. It was immensely tangy and outright sour, but tasted pretty great once I poured in about half of the sugar syrup that accompanied both drinks.\xa0', "Our soup exceeded expectations by delivering a perfect albeit confusing concoction of ginger, carrot, and orange. That's incidentally the name of the soup as well - Ginger, Carrot and Orange Soup. It comes with two tiny bits of amazing toast: buttered and garnished with herbs to perfection, crispy, and still warm. Not a bad deal for Rs. 450 at all.", "Our Pasta with Creamy Cheese and Mushroom was a nice, large portion, but was at room temperature. For something that took nearly an hour to reach us, we were looking forward to a nice, warm meal but nope. That said, it had a generous bit of mushroom in it, though the pasta itself was overcooked and too soft and soggy for our liking. It wasn't overpriced at Rs. 850, what with pastas around the city costing much more, but we can't really say this was satisfactory.", 'The Grilled Chicken with Mushroom (Rs. 980) came with a humungous side of mash and a lovely salad peppered with pickled gherkins. This looks great until you actually dig into it, whereupon you discover that the salad is 90% lettuce leaves with a mere topping of chopped bell peppers, gherkins, and vinaigrette.', "I shan't dwell too long on this, but the chicken was quite tough — almost like it had been fried for a while — and stringy.", 'None of their desserts were available, which was a pity.', "With our total coming just over Rs. 3500, we can't say we were satisfied with our meal. Props to friendly service and a lovely space to while your time away, but where food is concerned...nah.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Lovely ambience, slow food.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    We tried Ginger again.

Of course people can eat in cheaper places, but there is absolutely no way that Ginger is 'on a par' with Barista. I would much prefer to pay a little extra to sit in a well designed, well furnished, friendly cafe rather than somewhere like Barista, with its fake leather seats and plastic cheese sandwiches.

Service was slick and attentive from start to finish. Went with the recommendation from the wait staff; mutton pol Kiri badum, and a veg curry sandwich. The portions were ample and presented well. The mutton was tender and full of flavour probably after slow cooking for a while. The rice and cucumber salad were perfect accompaniments for the mutton. The veg curry sandwhich my wife got was amazing, chunky roast pan with an open top, filled with an aromatic veg curry on the hollowed out loaf accompanied by a perfect coconut sambol, and for 400 rupees a steal. Was too full to try out dessert, but the coffee we ordered to wash it down was fairly good. And the place was full by the time we finished dinner.
