name: Il Cielo
excerpt: New rooftop Italian fine dining restaurant behind Gangaramaya Temple
yamu_review: ['Il Cielo is the new Italian fine dining joint hidden behind Gangaramaya Temple. Run by the team who do Tsing Tao (which we ', '\xa0well), we went in hoping for good things. Unfortunately, the contemporary theme and stylish ambiance didn’t match the quality of the food or the service.', "As you head up the street, you’ll see a cool Il Cielo/Berlin Sky Lounge\xa0mural on the right hand side of the road and you'll find\xa0the restaurant\xa0opposite. First impressions are great once you get to the top, with a two floored indoor seating area and a large outdoor balcony (we’re not too sure what they do when it rains). We chose to sit on the balcony, where\xa0you get a great view of the Beira Lake and the surroundings. It seems this is one of the few areas of Colombo that doesn’t have high rises blocking the views, and it definitely helps. You can also see into the two tiered kitchen from the balcony, which is a slick touch.", 'Their décor is modern, and the seating well placed to give a busy but not crowded feel. This paired with some great chilled lounge/jazz music finished off the elegant milieu.', 'We opted for a\xa0starter to share, a couple of mains and a dessert. Once we had ordered, a bread basket arrived. The bread was a fragrant herby rosemary focaccia, but lacked seasoning and was dry.\xa0Its saving grace was the (also) herby butter, which was creamy and rich.', 'Our starter was ', '(prawns wrapped in bacon) at Rs. 690, which sounded awesome at face value. While the prawns were cooked reasonably well, the bacon was almost mushy and pretty tasteless, not giving the saltiness the prawns craved. Then the presentation was wholly unappetizing, with a meagre 3 prawns on the plate, one with its head fallen off, and then the tiniest smidge of balsamic glaze on the plate as though\xa0it was meant to be\xa0artsy.', 'This whole thrilling experience was interrupted by one of the mains, ', '(tagliatelle with pesto, Rs. 890), being brought 2 minutes after the starter arrived. We sent it back asking for it to be remade when the other main was ready so it wouldn’t be cold and congealed.', 'After the starter was removed, the tagliatelle reappeared pretty sharpish. Sadly our instructions had been ignored, and the pasta clearly had been left under a heat lamp, so was hot in some places and cold in others, and was sticking together in a congealed lump. Surprisingly the flavour of the pesto was beautiful, with the right balance of basil, oil and pine nuts, and the pasta was al dente. This was a recommendation from the waiter so we were impressed on that front, shame we couldn’t get it fresh.', 'About 40 minutes after the pasta had arrived; we finally got the second main, ', '(grilled calamari) at Rs. 1,190. Again presentation was woeful, with a pile of calamari on one side of the plate and a pile of roasted vegetables on the other. The calamari lacked seasoning and was rubbery while the vegetables had a distinct bitter after-taste. Considering this a very simple dish to make, execution was calamitous.', 'For dessert we went for the Italian staple of Tiramisu. While the flavour was lovely, the texture was not. The cream was watery, as if the Tiramisu had been frozen. Not a good end to the night.', 'For drinks we had the Kamikaze cocktail for Rs. 620 and an Apple Spark (apple, cider, and beer cocktail) at Rs. 480. The Kamikaze was well balanced, with a strong hit of lime to counter the sweetness. The Apple Spark on the other hand was poorly mixed and overly sweet so you either got a load of sugar or a smaller load of sugar depending if you drank from the bottom or the top of the glass. The concept could have worked if not for this, as the\xa0flavour of the apple, cider and beer were there, but were killed by the saccharine taste.', 'Service overall was below par, despite a very friendly manager. After\xa0arriving at\xa0such a nice environment, we were seated fairly quickly, and then it all went downhill. The waiter couldn’t seem to handle taking food and drink orders at once, we were asked for our drinks order twice. The pasta, as mentioned above, was brought too soon after the starter, and the calamari arrived ', ' later than\xa0the pasta. If the food didn’t kill the dining experience, this certainly did.\xa0It’s not fun watching your dining partner scoff down their food, while you have to wait, ravenous. The whole session\xa0took over 2 hours, which is way too long.', 'Il Cielo certainly has the location and ambiance on point, their food and service really lets it down though. This may be because the restaurant has only been open a week or two, so it may be teething issues.\xa0For now, we’d say go there for drinks and the pesto.\xa0']

Some of the waiters were nice. However, the food was a nightmare. I haven't had food this bad in a long time. It completely ruined our night. I would advise anyone not to waste their time and money on this place, unless the management takes some serious action on the state of the food. However, given that people have been writing bad reviews from the day they started operations and the management has done nothing about it means they clearly don't care and will probably run it to the ground. Please sell this beautiful place to a bunch of people who can run a real Italian restaurent. The current set up is a joke. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Went twice within a week and management have clearly acted on previous feedback since opening…tried a few dishes (pastas, pizzas and Schnitzel) and desserts with friends and all tasted great…food to match the ambience…would highly recommend it!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Absolutely a wonderful place to chill out and have a nice long talk with a clique.

The restaurant's night glass walls directly opened in to sun and their A/C was not coping to the heat. They put couple of fans but yet it wasn't enough.", '\r\n', '\r\nWe made the reservation day before and they knew 15 of us are coming.

None of us had any good comments on their plate unfortunately and some were contemplating of having a Evening food right after going back. Pizzas looked under baked and some pieces were left from all three we bought. There were no big complaints on stuffed chicken but it wasn't look like Italian at all. People who had pasta and spaghetti complained on the lack of any taste at all.", '\r\n', '\r\nThe whole bad experience cost us close to 25,000/-. That was only for mains.

None we ate were good despite the manager telling us they use original italian material. The place is clean and neat with a nice view to the distance but we went there to eat a good meal and hopelessly disapppointed. Two out of three entrees were not avaiable. Rocket salad was replaced with Iceberg, The frozen pizzas came at five minute intervals and half cooked and luke warm. Unappetizing. I think the business makes money on the bar above and do not care about the restaurant.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I would highly not recommend Berlin Sky Lounge, I had gone for my sister's birthday and there was a lot of room for improvement. Firstly, the speakers were really low quality and they were playing random music that wasn't suiting the ambience. Secondly, the food was a ridiculously overpriced. Also a friend who ordered whiskey asked for 50 ml and they brought him a 25 ml and claimed it was 50. We knew that it wasn't because when we asked for a 25 ml, it was the same amount as the prevpious drink. Just overall the experience wasn't satisfactory and I would recommend not going here. \n                                            "]
