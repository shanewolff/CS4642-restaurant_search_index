name: Quick Thai (Battaramulla)
excerpt: Quick Thai serves up a range of affordable Thai dishes that are low on refinement, yet big on taste, from its modest, but elegant Pelawatta premises.
yamu_review: ["Quick Thai has been around for as long as I can remember and they're one of the few places that serve Thai cuisine that's value for your money. We dropped in for a late lunch and walked out with our tummies full and hearts contented.\xa0", "It's located on Pannipitiya Road, between Pizza Hut and HSBC. In the earlier days, when Battaramulla didn't have a lot of places like ", ', ', ' or ', ", Quick Thai is where people went to have a decent meal. We're happy to say that they have managed to keep the quality of their food pretty consistent.\xa0", 'The Prawn Pad Thai Noodles (Rs. 770) we got was one of the best I have tried. The refined Thai flavours along with perfectly cooked prawns, peanuts and the lemongrass added up\xa0to spicy and filling noodles with a tinge of sweetness.', 'The Chicken with Cashew Nuts (Rs. 705) was amazing! There were lots of pieces of fried chicken soaked in a succulent and spicy sauce with cashews and sauteed veggies. The chicken was flavourful with a hint of sweetness which balanced out the spiciness of the sauce.', "If I see Hot Butter Mushroom (Rs. 450) on the menu, I get it. This was a bit sweeter than the ones I have had before but I can't say I didn't like it. It was perfectly on par with the rest of the dishes. It was on the menu as an appetizer but it could just as easily be a side dish because of the huge portion we received. The mushrooms were crispy and crunchy, with perfect seasoning. I highly recommend all you vegetarians give it a go.", "Unfortunately, they didn't have any of the desserts I was looking forward to, like the Sticky Rice with Mango or the Banana Fritters with Ice Cream.", "The Pineapple Juice (Rs. 395) we got was quite pricey for fruit juice, especially since the ratio was off. Halfway through the drink, I had to take the straw out and drink straight from the glass because it was just blended pineapple and no water. It was alright but I don't see myself ordering it again.\xa0", "Here's the thing. Before I went there I checked their Facebook reviews and almost all of them had said that their service is really bad. However, we didn't experience anything abysmally terrible. The staff was all smiles and brought our food to the table within 10-15 minutes. Although I do have to mention that they were quite impatient and didn't really give us time to decide on our order. It's distracting when the waiter keeps inching towards our table every 5 seconds.", "I really appreciate the themed ambience they have going on. With wooden tables and benches along with the\xa0woven table mats it really gives the feel of a Thai restaurant. They also have\xa0seating upstairs with cushioned furniture so if your butt hurts from sitting on wood, you can sit there. The place could use a bit of brightening because unless you're sitting near the window you won't get much lighting.\xa0", 'Quick Thai was a quality experience with delicious food. The prices are a tad pricey but you ', ' have a filling meal for about Rs. 1500 per head, which is alright considering you get to taste\xa0Thai cuisine in Colombo.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Serving authentic Thai with delicious, filling meals.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Quick Thai serves up a range of affordable Thai dishes that are low on refinement, yet big on taste, from its modest, but elegant Pelawatta premises.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    කොහොම වුණත් ක්වික් තායි ගැන අපේ තිබුණු හොඳ ඉම්ප්\u200dරෙෂන් එක, මෙදා සැරේ විසිට් එකෙන් තරමක් අඩු වුණා කියලයි අපේ හැඟීම නම්.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හැබැයි යාළුවනේ ක්වික් තායි අවන්හලේ කෑම ප\u200d්\u200dරමාණයෙන් නම් ටිකක් ලොකුයි. අපි දෙන්නටත් ඒක තේරුණේ බඩ පැලෙන්න කාලා ඉවර උනාට පස්සෙත් පිඟානෙ කෑම ටිකක් ඉතුරු වෙලා තියනව දැක්කාම.\n                                                                                                                            ']

Both restaurants are very clean and the food was excellent and authentic. The service was good and the staff were extremely attentive. Just because a restaurant is small doesn't mean that its full of rats, especially as you have absolutely no proof. Give them a chance. They’re a small business trying to make a name for themselves! Writing misleading reviews could really ruin all their hard work! \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Completely one-sided and highly derogatory piece of reporting.

Just had dinner at the Colombo outlet and have to say it\'s probably the best Thai at the price point and more authentic than some "Thai" restaurants in leading star class establishments. Having said that I have to mention that there was a piece of metal wire in the padthai, probably from a metal scouring wool. These things happen so I personally don\'t count that as a major blow to my meal, especially at that price point. The dish was as Thai as it would get this far from Bangkok taste wise. Green curry pork was the clear winner for the day and it was just as good as a proper Thai village green curry made by an old lady who speaks no English. Would give 4/5 and will return for more of that green curry for sure.  Would be interesting to see if they would expand the menu with more authentic Thai dishes than the fried rice and the stir fries. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Sorry awful service …very slow!

Both joints are very doable! But thank heavens for boring dull white rice to balance all those extreme in-your-face Thai flavours of every, delicious, dish we ordered! I feared that my order of 8 dishes for 4 persons would be too much and we would all be doggiebagging home. But I don’t know what secret ingredient of Thai food makes you greedy, because we ate everything. We had to roll back to our car though.', '\nThe complaint about too much smoke is valid. At one point it got kind of foggy in the restaurant. But then I realised that it partially was our own fault because: didn’t we just order that sizzling chicken number 70? And you know, if the chef puts something on those hot iron plates, a lot of smoke will circulate from the kitchen through the mosquito maze to the restaurant. So, sorry for that folks. If the management can’t improve the exhaust or do the sizzling in the open air, at the back, far away from dining guests, well, then I guess we have to accept that a good Thai bite equals smelly clothes. Or else there is always a classy hotel-Thai downtown.', '\nThe interior was sober but not unpleasant. It looked very clean, and so did the kitchen you can observe from behind glass.
