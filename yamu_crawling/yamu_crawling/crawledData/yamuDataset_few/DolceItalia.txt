name: Dolce Italia
excerpt: Dolce Italia is a new little bakery cum restaurant run by two Italians. They serve pastries and Italian favourites that are both authentic and affordable. 
yamu_review: ["Dolce Italia's new spot on Skelton Road is indicative of the brand maturing. Gone are the plastic tables and bright green decor of their old premises, the new spot is a cosy space with lots of seating, lots of staff, and even a pizza oven.", 'We decided to get one of our old Dolce favourites, the Shrimp Fettuccine (Rs. 1150). The waiter suggested red sauce, so we went with that. Slightly al dente, with oodles of fragrant and herby tomato-based sauce, the pasta was great, and surprisingly filling.', "They've got a whole new pizza menu now, so we decided to check out a couple of their toppings. We opted for half Quattro Formaggio (Rs. 1400) and half Pollo Spezie (Rs. 1300) upon the waiter's recommendation. Altogether, the pizza came to Rs. 1350. The 4 cheese was quite good, with a selection of imported cheeses including blue cheese gracing the light and thin base. \xa0", 'The spicy chicken topping was quite disappointing, as it basically tasted like curry and was so wet it soaked through the base giving it a roti-like consistency. Italian chicken curry and roti is not something you want to experience.', "The management noticed our pizza and told us the spicy chicken was a poor choice (we kind of wish they'd told the waiter this first!), and insisted on sending out a couple more pizzas for us to taste. They wouldn't charge us for\xa0these (clearly being a YAMU reviewer is no longer an anonymous profession), so we're not going to review them in detail. The Dolce special features a full fried egg hidden under two sheets of rubbery chicken bacon. The other is a veg-friendly Quattro Stagioni (without the traditional ham and salami).", 'They also insisted we try their kurakkan pizza, which was superb in its simplicity. Think of it as a starter or healthy replacement for garlic bread. In fact, you can use kurakkan as a base for any of the pizzas if you ask.', "As before, Dolce doesn't serve any alcohol, but they don't mind if you bring in a bottle of wine. Their drinks selection are the usual ice tea, soft drinks, and coffee, although they've invested in a shiny new coffee machine.", 'We tried an ice tea (Rs. 100) and lime soda (a tad pricey at Rs. 350), along with a cappuccino (also Rs. 350). The tea and soda were fine, straightforward cold drinks perfect for the heat.', 'Frothy, strong, and not burnt, the cappuccino was enjoyable. They use Guatemalan Arabica\xa0capsules in their machine rather than beans in order to maintain consistency.\xa0', "Their tiramisu (Rs. 350) is a real steal at that price, because it's packed with quality ingredients and prep. We highly recommend it, along with their other pastries, profiteroles, and eclairs (all around the same price).", "The service here has always been friendly and efficient. The waiters are very nice, but they're not always well-versed in Italian cuisine so you might want to speak to the owners/management if you want recommendations.\xa0", "The new ambience is lovely. A converted Colombo 5 house, the new Dolce has lots of space, seating, and natural light. There's also lots of stuff you can choose from their bakery/pastry\xa0section.\xa0", "I'm personally not a fan of pork-substitute products (like substituting bacon with chicken bacon or pepperoni with cut up bits of chicken sausage), but I understand Dolce's decision to keep their customers of different faiths happy. I really recommend trying out their kurakkan base, their pasta, or even just stopping in for a pastry and coffee. This is probably the most reasonable spot for good Italian fare in the city.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Our look at Dolce Italia's new premises on Skelton Road.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    We love the desserts here.

Went there for the first time to get their Tiramisu, only to be completely ignored by the staff, while they greeted and served their foreign customers who came after me, even though I had repeatedly tried to get their attention at the counter! A man who I believe was the owner saw this and asked the rude male staff member to see to me. I complained about what had just happened, very politely, bought my tiramisu to go, and left. Afterwards I see that in an act of petty revenge against myself, and I believe the owner too, this staff member had twisted and broken the spoon I had asked for! ', "\nAll I can say is that although the dessert was good, I will never go back here again! The owner may have been nice but his staff are awful. Either my appearance wasn't fancy enough (I wasn't wearing makeup) to warrant being served or I wasn't white enough, meaning that this place is either elitist or racist! All reasons to stay well clear. To the owner I will say, the food is good, and I could see that you try to keep a close eye on your staff, as am guessing this must have happened before, but you really need to replace that employee, as he clearly has no respect for customers and most importantly for you! \n                                    ", '\n                                            DELICIOUS Buffalo Mozarella pizza.

It must have been a bad luck to get an empty croissant, I never got any of those.  Further - a word "panini" comes from the italian word "pane" and that means - bread… Panini stands for "small loaf of bread" or a "roll"… Manuela and Samir are always there, and should be mentioned as "the most hard working caffe owners" - always kind and friendly. Dolce Italia is by far the best value for money in Colombo. Food is delicious, espresso is as strong as it should be. Thumbs up for Dolce Vita! Keep up the good job you are doing!! Bravi!!!

From the awesome baked goodness, to authentic homemade past dishes they deliver authenticity. It may not be the fancy, extravagant experience, but then hey they don't look to be a Michelin star restaurant :) only a homely, warm café. so in terms of what they set out to do, I would say they do a swell job. I love the warm atmosphere, and they  remember their customers too which I think is a nice touch, that most commercial oriented businesses lack. Their chocolate croissant is the best I have had since I had it back in Italy! I would keep going back every week, the only thing holding me back is where the calories would go to :) I highly recommend this for a warm, cozy dine in or and indulgent take away!!! I really hope this place sticks around for a long time. It is the only Italian bakery in Colombo and they really have brought the spirit of Italy <3\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    The lasagna is supposed to be their 'piece de resistance' , unfortunately it runs out pretty fast. However, I tried the fettuccine on a recent visit and it was fabulous. The food and the ambiance is excellent despite the place being quite small.   The only gripe I have is that they seem to have raised their prices after the great buzz they've received. Yamu needs to update the prices as all the items are now above the 900 range.  \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Oh this place is the best been there several times and its always a pleasure.

But anyway went for what we came for, the Shrimp Fettuccine, Chicken Lasagna, and Spinach Ravioli, for drinks we ordered Iced Coffee and an Orange juice. Felt the orange was a mix of cordial, the coffee was good though. We got two of our three mains, at which time they said they'd ran out of lasagna. So had to go through the menu again and decided to go for the Fettuccine al Pollo with chicken.  This was the better of the three and surprisingly the Shrimp Fettuccine wasn't impressive at all. The Ravioli was good but not to die for. For deserts we ordered Tiramisu, Passion Moose, and another Iced coffee. The tiramisu tasted odd, as if aged, the passion was little pungent. Sadly the second coffee has more  forth than coffee. On the plus side, the waiter was great, enthusiastic & kind. We got some cookies, which I believe is given to dinners who put up a good bill. They were just okay. So to conclude, good experience, wanted something different to the usual Chinese, Kottu, Bugers, Subs and Thosais.

I'm not too sure about their other branches but their havelock road branch service and food is awful. As soon as I entered the upstairs dining area with my wife not a single person was there and I can understand why. The small boy waiter who looks around 16 years old is really rude. He kept hovering over us and making us give our order fast. To make matters worse the pasta I had was completely undercooked. When I asked him to send it back and get it cooked properly he rolled his eyes and swore at us in sinhala. Since we looked like foreigners he assumed we didn't understand. As I proceeded to ask him why he is using such foul language with us he had the audacity to ask me to leave if I wasn't happy. When I asked for the manager he told me he was in negambo and that he is in charge. This little boy who doesn't even look old enough to buy a beer says that to paying customers. Why do people hire such adolecent children.
