yamu_review: ["If you're a foodie, you probably don't mind having to cook your own meals. This is basically what dining at a Korean restaurant involves. Your order comes to the table unprepared, and you're given a grill to cook them to your liking. It's a pretty immersive experience, to say the least, and can be quite fun with a crowd or even on a date. We like Han Gook Gwan for its reasonable pricing, though we were served up some fishy sashimi, when we went for lunch.", 'Ordering is pretty simple. You go through the options of pork, cuttlefish, ox-tail\xa0and make your pick. Along with your order, you get an array of sides that come free of charge. These include kan kun, omelette, kimchi, peanuts, lettuce and onions, as well as a tofu soup.', "Worthy of mention of these sides was the kimchi. The thing is, you don't get properly fermented kimchi at Korean restaurants in Sri Lanka. Still, the version we get here might be more suited to our palate. It's spicy, it's got a sour kick. It's got a good crunch. We like.", 'Kinita was particularly taken up by the soup. Very light and subtle with its flavour, it felt quite homely with soft chunks of tofu that worked well with the broth.\xa0', 'So we ordered Roast Pork Ribs\xa0(Rs 1000) though what we got were cuts of meat, with only one or two actual ribs and it was cold. Still, we got quite a lot of meat.\xa0', 'So this is where the fun starts. You fire up your grill and start placing the meat onto it. Then watch as it starts to sizzle and smell engulfs the table.\xa0', 'Oh, and we also got the Cuttlefish and Pork Mixed In Chili Paste (Rs 1300) which was the bomb. You pretty much have to stir fry this one, so you get a different cooking element.', "It's got plenty of cabbage going on, but there's lots of cuttlefish and pork in there, too. The flavours are spicy and sweet, without being too sour, and they just work perfectly. The sweetness of the sauce and the fattyness of the pork is just right together, while the crunch of the cuttlefish keeps it fresh.", "Last, and least, please don't order food from another cuisine at a restaurant. Kinita decided we needed some rice to go along with our orders and asked for the Sashimi and Vegetables on a\xa0Bed of Steamed Rice. What we were served were frozen chunks of fish that looked so off-coloured that we were nearly put off our lunch altogether. Needless to say, we didn't touch it.", "With bright yellow walls and brighter white lights, this place doesn't feel too dodgy. It's actually kinda cute, and we saw quite a few women gathered quite comfortably. So it seems women-friendly. The waiters are fairly helpful but mostly stand far away near the kitchen, so you need to get their attention by flailing your arms. Don't holler. That's rude.", "Han Gook Gwan , or Korean dining in general, is great for when you want to change things up and make food exciting again. You don't need to go shopping to cook a great meal, just let them provide the produce for you. It's a great spot for a group gathering, a family outing or even a date. Don't order sashimi, though.", '\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Han Gook Gwan, or Korean dining in general, is great for when you want to change things up and make food exciting again. \n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Han Gook Gwan does a authentic take on Korean cuisine at a price that will keep you going back for more.

It's been around since the late 1980s, and it’s currently the only Korean restaurant left in the country. It isn’t a fancy place – there’s little to no décor, and it’s more of a Korean hangout that a restaurant catering to Sri Lankan customers.\n                                                                                                                            "]

The won't see me anymore and I'll stick to my usual good restaurants. 4550 for a noodles dish and 2 fried seafood and pork dishes… a rip off!\n                                    ", '\n                                            ', '\n                                    ']

Cos finally when he managed to take me there and I loved it more than any other place in town. Food is tasty and fun the way they serve it. Korean ice-cream is the best thing ever. May be you guys visited the place on a bad day, the smell didn’t bother us at all.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Oh dear, we didn't mean to dissuade you from visiting!

My husband and I were planning on a take-away and since the parking was full, i requested to take the menu out to discuss what our options for dinner would be. I was told that i was not allowed to take the menu outside despite security being there, so when i requested someone accompany me as my husband was in the car, they promptly told me they were too busy. I asked how long the food would typically take and was told that it would take a long time. The restaurant wasn't even full! Clearly they were not interested in serving us. We then went to Tang Dynasty and they immediately came outside, gave us the menu, were very polite, took our order and gave us tasty food in 10 minutes. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    absolute terrible service. rude, unpleasant staff. food was ok\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Once again yamu, once again….  Sashimi and Sushi are a part of Korean cuisine as well although the origins are likely to be from Japan. They were colonized by Japan and I am speculating it came from that period. Also, that dish doesn't look like Sashimi from the presentation as well as the cuts so it is likely the Korean equivalent  . know your cuisines without making blatant remarks lol all it takes is to google it without trying to act like a know-it-all and being ignorant.

It's like saying don't try Sri Lankan biriyani because it isn't the exact same thing as Indian biriyani.  \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    so what if it is? Yamu has become a trusted site for me and has not failed me yet. If the restauranteur has made the grave mistake of calling his dish "sashimi", so be it.  it doesn\'t have to look like what we are used to or what it is called in its native land. let us not be jobless individuals who nag and find fault with reviews that have been put up for our sakes.  why waste time reading it if it isn\'t worth it? i find the best sites for reviews in each country i visit and YAMU has been the best in my stay in Sri Lanka. i enjoyed the food in this restaurant when i missed Korean food.
