When I saw the prices of the stuff I wondered if I was in Colombo or Chennai - they are that cheap! They give P&S a run for their money. Remember those round stove top toasters we had those days? they had salmon toasties of it, I cant recall anyplace or shop giving soo much of salmon filling! Love it! Now the ladies there by default packs me a salmon toastie when I walk in :) They don't have items in large quantities, so u might be disappointed if you walk in for brunch. Also try their home made ginger beer if its available, will kick start your day.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    What time of day do you go in for the salmon toasties?
