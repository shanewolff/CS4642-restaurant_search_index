I literally mean in. The place was filthy with around 1000 tissues near the hand washroom area. Smelling bad, I saw around 2  huge rats running in the area I went to wash hands. Staff was crap and ambiance was not up to standards either.   Food was okay, surely not worth the money as its worse than a small place like Pilawoos  by standards, I suggest to avoid this place like a plaque. They should bring some Sri Lankan managers as Indians cant run the place. Its tottaly bad.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Extremly bad customer service, and there is no timly service. ', '\r\nIn the matter of food also, they have over with salt ans chilli etc beyond the limit, which is not a healtly food. ', '\r\nLess staff with motive to take orders, and no prompt deliver, we had to keep on asking them the order on "how long will it take" in reguler', '\r\n', '\r\nI have made decision not to visit again to this place and put a written feed back to them via post. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Nice food,  good taste. worth for money.  the menu serves both north and south Indian dishes.  dosa were great, even naan,roti and other north Indian curries were also good. good place to visit for a mixed Indian meal.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Nice place for decent Indian food with normal prices. They serve both south and north Indian foods. you can really try some good south Indian Dosa, Idly,Wadai and some good north Indian breads and curries. must try it. Ample parking is available .\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Nice place for decent Indian food with normal prices.

With SC and tax it came to a whopping 635.25 LKR. ', '\r\nNot worth spending that much for a vegetarian meal.  The food was somewhat tasty. But not worth 600+ bucks.   Customer service is below par.  So too is the ambiance. \n                                            ']
