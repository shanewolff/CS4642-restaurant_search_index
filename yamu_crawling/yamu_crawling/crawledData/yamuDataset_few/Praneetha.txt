yamu_review: ['Praneetha, a previous hole-in-the-wall\xa0', 'has now become a slightly pish posh\xa0', '\xa0with A/C and less stuffy seating space. But is it still a 5 star ', 'spot?\xa0', 'We dropped in on a Tuesday afternoon for a quick lunch to find out.', 'With good air conditioning comes slight price hikes. We got a Chicken Rice and Curry for Rs 200, an increment since our past visit but it still manages to be on par with the\xa0standard price for a basic rice and curry. We also ordered a\xa0Seafood Fried Rice priced at a whopping Rs 600. Never in my life have I\xa0ever\xa0paid so much for fried rice at a\xa0', '.', 'The portion of rice and curry came with the customary mountain of rice, accompanied by curries of the likes of\xa0dhal, mango,\xa0', '(jack fruit), chicken, of course, and a gotukola sambol. Despite finding the dhal a little too salty, the rice and curry made for a good portion\xa0with the\xa0spicy chicken curry mingling well with the much-loved combo of the mellow\xa0', '\xa0and tangy mango. It was standard\xa0and satisfying.', 'We were made to wait for over 15\xa0minutes for this ginormous Seafood Fried Rice. While Rs 600 is too much by ANY\xa0', '\xa0standards (with A/C or without) this could have been easily shared between 2 people (or among 3 carb-conscious people). There were plenty of cuttlefish rings, prawns, pieces of fish and deep fried crab which had a soft crunch and tasted great.\xa0Overall, it was good, but just not great. Had it been spicier and a little less dry, it would have been a solid fried rice.', 'While other spots have unlimited\xa0', "Praneetha does a healthier take and offers unlimited slices of cucumber and leaves of lettuce. There's a tray full of deep-fried chilies too, for that extra kick.", 'Want to witness a Lankan version of Gordon Ramsay? Head to Praneetha during noon on a busy weekday. The man behind the counter is constantly screaming out orders and comments with a dose of annoyance\xa0to his masked elves. Makes for good entertainment if you low-key love drama.', "Praneetha seems to be a popular lunch spot\xa0for office staff around the area. We walked in at about 11.50 am to a room full of lunch-deprived men and women. But it's mostly seen as a takeaway spot\xa0rather than dine-in, but the new location does have seating for about 10-15 people.", "They've also got a huge frame that would remind you of what an Island lad/lass you are as you work your way through your rice and curry.", "As is the case with most places, with expansion, there seems to be a slight drop in their quality. But they still stand as\xa0a reliable option for a good\xa0Lankan lunch if you're around the area.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    From a hole-in-the-wall to an A/C buth kadey!\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Praneetha is a little hole in the wall buth kade that serves up a great rice and curry with the option of every kind of meat, from prawns to pork. \n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හප්පච්චියේ! නබීලා ගත්ත සීෆුඩ් ෆ්\u200dරයිඩ් රයිස් එකේ තිබුණු මාළු ජාති තොගේ! තඩි ඉස්සෝ, ලොකුවට කපපු දැල්ලෝ රවුම්, බැදපු කකුළු මස්, තලපත් මාළු කෑලි ලෝබ නැතුව මේකට දාලා තිබුණා.\n                                                                                                                            ']
