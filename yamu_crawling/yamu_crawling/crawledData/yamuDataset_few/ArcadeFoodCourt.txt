name: Arcade Food Court 
excerpt: Since the only proper food courts we've had in the city have been at Crescat, Excel World, Liberty and Majestic City - it's with great relief that we welcome the new one at the brand spanking new Arcade Independence Square. We think the atmosphere especially and the food here is a little notch above that of your average Colombo food court.

It's a normal fried rice, the one you find in almost any Chinese restaurant. The best thing about the place is the seating arrangement outside and if you are lucky you can get a table under the shade (there are only two or three such spots) ", '\r\n\n                                    ']

Did you actually go during lunch? The place is impractical. I don\'t know how the food necessarily a notch above other food courts. It\'s decent, but you have to eat in the burning hot sun without much wind. Avoid during lunch, certainly not "Best time". I\'m sure it\'s ok for evenings and night.

Initially I thought the canteen is only for them. But don't worry, I saw even a few 'rich looking' people are also going there. I didn't have a time to go inside and taste their food but from what I observed from out side I felt that the ambience is not very good. I can't say anything about food as I haven't tasted them. (hope to do so when I go there next time). Anyway we can't expect the same quality as kaema suthra, t-lounge or even burger kings for a much smaller price. You always get what you pay for. But I hope this canteen people also have some decent quality control. I personally believe that they could have provided a better ambience so that those who can't afford for more 'posh' restaurants won't feel discriminated.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Dear YAMU, I would like to clarify something about the Asylum, whether it is a bar meant for alcoholic people or a restaurant meant for anyone who wish to dine in. As I am a teetotalar who has never tasted even a beer (& a non-smoker) I feel uncomfortable whenever I go a place where alcohol is served. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    We'll definitely do a post on it in the near future.

We've been there twice now, the level of cleanliness in the dining area is unacceptable. Sticky tables and the poorly maintained hand washing area is what you call the good atmosphere? Oh and the RATS! too many fat rats roaming to grab the food OMG !!!! I wonder why none noticed that….! No pest control! And about the food, it was ok… Cheese dosa from krishna was good. The elephant house ice cream is way over priced for their size of scoops (they were so small :/) And finally about Kema sutra (though it is not relevant to this article) since the restaurant was full at the time we went there, we ordered Kottu, egg rotis, jumbo prawns for take-away and had it in the arcade dinning area. Price was not too bad for the size of the portions but the taste was terrible…\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    yes ON14 ', '\r\nIdeal place for drinks\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Krishna & Paan Paan is no more!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    New one to review - City Food Arcade at Fairway Zmax Hotel\n                                            ']

address: 30, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7 
directions: The Arcade is right opposite the Post Office on the Avenue - the big white buildings and fountains will be hard to miss. When you enter, look for the central fountains - the seating space on the right of it is just outside the food court.
