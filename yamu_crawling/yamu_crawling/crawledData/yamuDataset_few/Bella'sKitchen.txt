yamu_review: ["It's a bit of a hassle deciding what to eat for breakfast/lunch every day and waking up early enough to actually make food. Bella's Kitchen is a convenient food delivery service that takes care of this for you. We tested them out for a week.", "They'll dispatch a rider to your address and all you have to do is pay them for the week and hand over two lunch boxes. They'll alternate between the boxes throughout the week.\xa0", "If you don't have two lunchboxes to spare, they'll settle for foil containers instead, but this is bad for the planet.", 'The whole package for the week cost us Rs. 1,400.', 'Each meal comes with fruit, yoghurt or a sweet item as an accompanying dessert.\xa0', "On Monday we got pasta with minced chicken and an apple. The pasta was a tad overcooked, but the chicken was quite flavourful. There wasn't a lot of chicken, but there didn't ", " to be a lot. While the pasta could've been a bit better, this is still a filling meal.", 'Tuesday was our favourite. Easily the best meal of the week, we got some excellent ', ' with a large piece of delicious curried chicken and yoghurt for dessert. The rice was well prepared with tons of vegetable bits and a bit of gravy. A hearty lunch to make up for the Tuesday blues.', "On Wednesday we received a tuna and mayo sandwich with a banana for dessert. This didn't really stand out although the sandwich came with a lot of filling. The tuna was obscured by the mayo and we pretty much only got to taste the lettuce and tomato.", "Still, we weren't complaining too much because lunch was taken care of and we didn't even have to make it ourselves.", "This doesn't look bad but it was our least favourite. It was supposed to be spaghetti but was cooked in a way that made it taste like traditional Lankan style noodles but in a bad way. The sausage didn't make up for it either, and we couldn't finish the whole thing.", 'The second best parcel after the ', ". Friday we got fried rice, with a healthy serving of chop suey and chicken. For dessert we got a little donut but it isn't pictured here because I got greedy and wolfed it down.", 'The rice was quite delicious because it came mixed with chicken gravy and was seasoned adequately which we really liked.', "Well, yeah. You can check out their Facebook page because they've got different versions of these packages. You can pick and choose from a variety of menus from Sri Lankan to Western.\xa0", "If you're a constantly busy parent or you just don't have time to spend on making a sandwich, these guys are pretty much your solution. They're quick, hassle free and won't put a dent in your wallet. Plus they're an excellent way to plan your meals for the week.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Bella's Kitchen delivers food parcels.
