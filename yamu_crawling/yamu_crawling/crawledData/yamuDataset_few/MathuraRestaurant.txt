name: Mathura Restaurant
excerpt: Mathura is a decent Indian vegetarian restaurant that has been around Colombo for years, but now at a new location.
yamu_review: ['Mathura doesn’t really require a fancy description – it has been around for the longest of times, known for the veg friendly Indian that they serve. (If you have never heard of Mathura, you have probably lived under a rock – no hate though. \xa0*insert hug*', 'And now, they are at a new location! No longer do they operate from behind the bus stop in Havelock town.', 'Although the famous Mathura served some soooooper Indian (veg), the quality deflated over the years. So, I was rather curious to see what the\xa0new Mathura\xa0had in store for me.\xa0It took approximately 10 minutes for the food to be served, which wasn’t too long.', 'My North Indian thali (Rs. 530) was huge. Plated on the massive silver tray\xa0in true thali style were rasam, dhal, vegetable kadai, two potato curries, vegetable biriyani, a tiny pot of rice, a naan/chapathi (because it looked like naan, but tasted like chapathi), curd and kesari bhath.', 'The rasam, I believed, could have had a stronger dose of seasoning as it didn’t come off as spicy as rasam usually is. The\xa0curries were basic, but tasted good and were well spiced. While there was nothing I could really complain of with the contents of the thali, the veg biriyani was the real winner.', 'For someone who is forever in love with biriyani and thinks it’s abominable to exclude meat from the glorious dish, the veg biriyani was beyond impressive! So well flavoured that I didn’t whine about not having a small piece of chicken to go with it.', "What you don't see in the pic is a little cup of paneer that came along with the thali.\xa0The paneer was creamy and yum, and the kesari bhath, (which is a sweet dish [first from left])\xa0was done justice with the taste of ghee combining well with\xa0the level of sweetness.", 'On the whole, I really did like my veg thali, despite not having any meat.\xa0', "The paper masala dosa (Rs 380) was, unbelievably, not greasy! Coming across non-greasy, non-oily South Indian is a rare delight.\xa0Enveloped in a crispy, long dosa, the masala-fied potatoes hit the right spot with the spices. While my friend felt it wasn't spicy enough, I personally thought it matched the quality of dosas that you'd find in any little shop in the south of India. But\xa0I would have preferred more generous portions of the\xa0sambar and chutneys.", 'For dessert, I got myself a portion of Gulab Jamun\xa0(Rs 200) that was delivered hot in a bowl of sugar syrup. It was a little too dark in color and looked overfried.\xa0Biting into it, expecting it to feel like a brick, I realized they were right when they said, "Don\'t judge a book by its cover,"\xa0because these were really soft on the inside, while also giving me a high risk of diabetes. Too, too sweet.', '\xa0', 'We were served\xa0by a helpful waiter who was also a little forgetful.', 'Helpful enough to give me polite instructions on how to eat my thali and forgetful enough to tell me one of the three veggie dishes off the thali\xa0was\xa0paneer, when in fact, it was not.', "Despaired by not finding any paneer despite poking my fingers in the most gross manner possible\xa0(PANEER IS IMPORTANT. DON'T JUDGE.), I merely enquired about\xa0which of the curries was paneer. Without a reply, he returned with a small cup filled with\xa0paneer and brought along the chef, who very kindly\xa0explained paneer wasn't on the menu for the day. Too much confusion to deal with, but they are still new on the block. Hence, shall be excused.", 'In terms of interior, I would say Mathura has done a splendid job. Spacious and generous seating (including upstairs) coupled with the faint sounds of Hindi music give the restaurant a whole new vibe.\xa0', '\xa0', "I wasn't disappointed. The food was\xa0of good quality and service was friendly. Although in terms of price\xa0it's more than your average ", ", it's not too bad - more affordable than catching a flight to Chennai for some dosas.", 'It would, however, be nice to see Mathura extend their dessert choices with more than just one Indian dish on the list.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Go for the Dosa, stay for the Thali.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    One of Colombo's oldest South Indian restaurants, Mathura serves reliable pure-veg fare in a middle-class environment.

The Madras coffee is very nice. ', '\n', "\nHowever if you order a Thali you have to be assertive. The bowls on the tray are very small and they don't offer refills. Not even a first round of rice.

But very recently their customer service has deteriorated a lot. I had a very bad experience recently. On a busy Sunday they had only three stewards to serve and they were not even listening to what we are ordering with a conscious mind. I ordered two Kulcha and around one hour later ultimately received only one and got to know that the steward who wrote down my order has not done it correctly. Number of stewards they have is not sufficient at all on a busy Sunday and it's like receiving service from a specialist doctor of a channeling service.

My overall review is, it has a Indian look and feel to the place. Enjoy the food with some authentic Indian slow music which kind of set the mood for me. Also I would have so to say the service was great, they knew exactly want we wanted and their recommendations to what to try ( if your new), was just great. ', '\r\n', '\r\nIt did take a little long time to make the preparations, but it was worth while the wait to try out their amazing dishes. I do recommend trying the cashew nut rice and masala curry including all their paneer dishes as well. Also a great sweet at the end of the meal. ', '\r\n', '\r\nI was happy to even introduce couple of my friends to the place, who were not so keen on going since i was a vegetarian place but soon grew to love it and I think they are coming by even without my help.

In the end I stood up and asked the cashier for my money back, and gave the counter guy a shelling. Then the counter guy ran to the back and came back about 5 minutes later with my order.There was a man there, who had come to collect an order, he too made a fuss about the tardiness. He was a helper type of guy who told me that they had ordered the food in the afternoon and he was told to come at a particular time and he's still waiting, This type of service is not good enough.
