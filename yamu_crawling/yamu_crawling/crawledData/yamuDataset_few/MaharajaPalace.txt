The prices haven't changed much over the past couple of years but this is still one of the more expensive Indian restaurants, but also one of the classier.

The Kebabs definetly live upto the description of "Melt In The Mouth" & my favourite Nann is Cheese too. The ambiance definetly gives you the feeling of dining in A Palace. Service standards need to be lifted. Good things in life are not cheap they say, but I feel that every Ruppee spent at Maharaja Palace is worth it and prices are not exhorbitant in comparison to the other reputed Indian restaurants in the city.

Anyone can serve bad food in copper dishes. Copper dishes are a gimmick. Also Maharajah has not Sri Lankanized it's food and retains the delicate touch of true North Indian cuisine. I think if you ask the Indians who eat there, they will agree. I suspect those unhappy with Maharajah are either looking for spicier food associated more with the South of India or have been introduced to some inauthentic versions of North Indian food.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Visited the place yesterday.', '\r\nAmbiance: Excellent', '\r\nFood: Good', '\r\nService: Good ', '\r\nLocation: Very Good', '\r\nMenu: Excellent\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The service of staff and the restaurant manager was so poor.

After making a reservation for a table for 6 upon arrival we were allocated a table under 2 air conditions. As it was too cold we asked if we could move as there were many empty tables around, but we're told that all were reserved.
