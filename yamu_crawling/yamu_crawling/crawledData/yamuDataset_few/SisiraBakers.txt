Rs 170/=" but dinemore has 4 stars?!?!?!?', '\r\n', '\r\nMakes me feel that your rating is based on brand name rather that the quality of the food. The pics of the burgers here look much better than the 3 star dull zinger burger at Mc Donalds.

I had the chicken club sandwiches of theirs which was just 200 bucks… It's even better than the dinemore club sandwitches… So totally worth! Should try their submarine next time\n                                            "]
