But overall it was a good experience and thinking of visiting again sometime soon :) \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    we happened to stumble into this place for dinner and I must say it seemed just like an eatery in Beijing. Its a very very acquired atmosphere, with the first whiff of everything Chinese when you open the door, you fall in love with it or you'd puke.", '\n', "\nwe truly truly fell in love with it and can't wait to go back!!\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    The food was quite good but the menu was confusing AF. The locals working there seemed even more perplexed as to what was going onâ€¦\n                                            ']
