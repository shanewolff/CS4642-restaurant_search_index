I'm like, excuse me, why do you need my phone number? And the guy behind the counter said they wanted to send me news about their promotions. I politely declined.

Here was a crispy taco covered in a tortilla, so it wouldn't break apart and spill its contents all over the place.", "The Chocodilla (Rs.200)\xa0tastes basically like a chocolate rotti, you must have had them at Pillawoos or down South at some point.

Anyway, the drinks weren't anything to get too excited about.\xa0", "The service is smiley and welcoming. There is a clearly evident, thick facade of very strong training. Interestingly, we didn't spot any women on the staff the time we were there. No idea if this is normal for Taco Bell Colombo.

Chicken and seafood as the only choices? Btw Taco Bell has never been considered Mexican. It's usually referred to as Tex-Mex. The next person to refer to Taco Bell as Mexican will be punished with having to give Kinita a foot massage for an hour at Yamu HQ. Unbelievable that they don't have beef on the menu!!!
