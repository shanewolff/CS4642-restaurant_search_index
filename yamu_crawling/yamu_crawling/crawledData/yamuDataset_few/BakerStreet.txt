It seems to me that food is not one of those areas. You can't call your self a food critique just because you have eaten out in few places ( including foreign countries). Food is a cuisine. It takes a lot of experience to appreciate different flavors and to understand how and why a certain dish is designed that way. As a hotelier( food and beverage dpt,) myself I must say you commenting on F & B, which is my profession (as well as many others), is quite offensive and irritating at the same time. So please stick to what you know, comment and criticize your own profession\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    The fried rice and the Kotthu is very good.

I was impressed with the place and most of all it is clean. Baker Street I will definitely be returning for more.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Thanks Yamu for your contribution. I live in Kotahena and had not heard of this place. i was pleasantly surprised whe I visited. They had a good variety of food. We tried the Chicken Kothu, the pizza and a chicken and beef burger. I must say the burgers far exceed what you would get at Mcdonalds. The Pizza was very good and the Kottu was also great. All in all a a great place and very convenient for us. Thanks Yamu for sharing.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I agree with Nishani. The burgers are excellent. Easily the best I have tasted in a long time and it is made to order so you get it fresh if you are willing to wait 5 - 10 minutes. Good show.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Hey they have a branch in Ratmalana as well.

Me and my Husband has been stopping here on our way home after work. Excellent staff!!! One night, I was about to buy a fish bun, which I was planing to keep until the next day and have it for breakfast. When I told this to the guy at the counter, He simply sniffed it and said not to buy it… I know any other shop would care less about customers and would try to get rid of the left over food by night. But this guy was genuine enough to tell me it was baked in the morning and not to buy it… ', '\r\n;)\n                                            ']
