I think that was one of the reasonable Coffee machine friendly ground coffee available for locals. Others wont stand a chance.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I did a comparison plain espresso (without sugar) of both Hansa Coffee(pure arabica) and Lavazza with my saeco espresso machine. Honestly Hansa coffee tasted more burnt taste (over roasted) and had very less aroma and crema compared to lavazza. I don't know they may be use different coffees in their coffee shop. btw Hansa coffee 100g was 285/= and the lavazza 200g  around 1700/= so there is a huge price gap.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    There is a new air conditioner. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    After no reply to email inquiry about buying their coffee beans.( I asked about roasted and green beans and their 1 kg prices) decided to go from Negombo to Colombo. I was one of 2 customers, the other one already served and sitting.', '\r\n', '\r\nWas quite astounded at their 500gm coffee bean price (1500 rupi) That is 3000 rupi / kg, and almost double of what I pay for Ethiopian Sidamo or Yirchafe beans. Thinking perhaps Hansa would put Sidamo to shame I tried an espresso at 260  (2 usd) ', '\r\n', '\r\nImpressions; no bitterness or bitter aftertaste BUT no remarkable taste and far from the Ethiopian flavors that jump out at you.', '\r\n', '\r\nI was very surprised to see no grinder and 2 small low end semi-automatic HOME espresso machines. The crema on my seems to have the bubbles that are famously seen in pressurized portafilter (make crema from anything) home espresso machines.  They used pre-ground coffee. Not to say a home espresso setup canot make decent espresso but that requires a low end burr grinder and proper setup. ', "\r\nAlthough I am not a fan of Lavazza (common supermarket coffee in Italy) in this case I'd have to choose Lavazza over Hansa. Just coincidentally I recently fired up my old Electrolux home espresso machine to use the Casino brand european coffee podsI bought in Cambodia at 5 usd retail. 36 pods/5usd (650 rupee approx?) Even the supermarket brand pods had a lot more flavor. About 2 blocks away I stumbled upon a restaurant coffee shop(Hazari) that priced their espresso shots at 260 also, but they had a 2 group commercial machine, commercial grinder and using roasted in Italy coffee beans. As I was heading back to Negombo I wondered if Hansa had perhaps quoted me an exaggerated price for beans since there were NO prices posted for coffee beans or ground. I have bought Carraro brand roasted in Italy 1kg beans in Cambodia for 15usd  about 2000 rupee and 1/3 less than Hansa grown in Sri Lanka, sold in Sri Lanka beans.", '\r\n', '\r\nThey could improve a bit by using a grinder and a commercial espresso machine or at least a better home machine such as a Rancilio Rocky. ', '\r\n', "\r\nVerdict; acceptable and I'd even say better than Starbucks espresso but as coffee aficionados and baristas know, Starbucks is over roasted and bitter and usually their espresso true taste is masked in flavored milk.  For 260 rupee I'd choose the Italy roasted espresso but not over a Tanzinian or Ethiopian single origin shot.  I was disappointed at Hansa.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    steve:', "\nyou sound like a coffee nerd! that's awesome!

Hansa's arabica coffee is mild in flavour & doesn't have the aroma of African beans (Kenya, Ethiopia etc ). This is both because of the terroir (flavour that comes from the land), the sorting/grading of the raw coffee bean and the roasting style (Hansa's coffees are on the darker end, but you should try their 'pure arabica' , it's lighter than the rest of their range. I've tried quite a few roasted Sri Lankan coffees, both from roasters & stuff I've roasted myself.
