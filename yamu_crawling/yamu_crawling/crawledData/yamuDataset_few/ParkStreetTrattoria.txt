name: Park Street Trattoria
excerpt: Park Street Trattoria is the newest addition to Park Street's fancy repertoire of restaurants. They've got a beautiful space, but the food has definite room for improvement.
yamu_review: ["We've been eyeing the shiny new Trattoria eagerly for a while now. With an enviable location on the Park Street strip, the restaurant boasts Colombo stalwarts like Park Street Mews, Curve, and now Café Français as neighbours.", "It fits the mews vibe perfectly, with its open plan structure and chic decor. They tout themselves as the P.S.T, which is linguistically convenient if not uncomfortably close to P.T.S.D. Let's break this review down into the good, the bad, and the upsetting.", 'The ambience is superb. The open plan New York loft structure could easily nestle into the meatpacking district, and lends itself equally well to the laidback strip vibe of the Mews. The P.S.T also features a cosy coffee and gelato area downstairs and a dining area on the mezzanine floor. The gelato is supplied by Il Gelato, and the coffee is illy, an Italian staple.', "The interior decor is on point too, with chic exposed-filament bulbs giving everything a lovely warm glow. Sure, they also require as much energy as a toddler on a sugar rush, but perhaps it's worth it. The emphasis on natural materials and warm tones is great, with open brick, wood, and rope accents. We also adored the smooth jazz covers they have lilting in the background. It's absolutely conducive to a chat with good friends, or some cutesy gazing with special friends.", "I've been there twice, and each time a nice server named Damien took charge, earnestly whipping out his spectacles while scribbling down my order. The staff appears to know its way around the menu, with the ease and knowledge to recommend or explain dishes.", 'They do take their time to get to you, with just two waiters upstairs handling everything upstairs, but they are quite efficient nevertheless. The staff has also been very courteous in handling reservations, special requests, and chilling champagne.', "Here's where things start to disintegrate. Given the ambience, service, and location, we were exceedingly enthused about trying the food. To say that the hype didn't live up to the reality would be a deluded understatement. The menu was promising - simple, straightforward Italian fare, printed on simple, straightforward bits of paper. We liked the ease and simplicity of it, interpreting the relatively short menu as confidence in what they had to offer.", 'We even waited a couple of weeks to ensure the restaurant had gotten into the swing of things and had time to settle down. The palpability of our disappointment was inversely proportional to the palatability of the food.', 'We ordered two trattoria staples, a carbonara at Rs 1050 and a chicken salad at Rs 780. Both fell under the "small plates" category, which I think is a mistranslation of the Italian primi piatti, as it doesn\'t mean the portions are smaller here. In Italy, the first course is usually a lighter vegetarian dish, but since the prices were alright, we didn\'t get too pedantic.', "To cut a long and painful story short, both dishes were abysmal. The chicken was tough and stringy, and appeared to have been pan fried rather than grilled. It was tossed in balsamic more acerbic than Willam Belli's wit, which didn't help. The carbonara looked lovely, the sauce showing a great creamy consistency. However, upon closer inspection, we realised that the meat used wasn't pancetta or guanciale but little strips of supermarket bacon, which were really soft and fatty. The most heartbreaking part though, was the taste. It was so intensely salty that I had to try and clear my palate with numerous bits of bread, prosecco, and water.", 'I was unfortunately compelled to ask the manager if it was a mistake, and whether the chef accidentally resalted my dish twice. She was incredibly sweet, and helpful, and insisted on replacing the dish immediately. However, she told me that the intense salty flavours are caused by pancetta, which seemed to be a non sequitur since there was clearly no actual pancetta in the dish. The replacement scraped by. It was less salty, but the fatty bacon strips remained, and this time around the eggs in the sauce had scrambled - sigh.', 'Feeling blue and betrayed, we ordered a tiramisu to take the edge off, which worked. It was well done, not too sweet, albeit a little too viscous for me.', 'A week later, I returned to P.S.T just in case the first visit was on a very off day. The restaurant is pretty enough to deserve a second chance, so this time around we went for dinner and ordered a soup of the day for two at Rs 550, a carbonara again in order for comparison\'s sake, and a "big plate" of spaghetti marinara.', 'The soup, a creamy pumpkin concoction, was great. A well flavoured offering with a slightly thick feel, it was perfect, steaming refuge from the monsoon storm outside. 10 points! Again, expectations rose for the main course. I quickly learnt why they say expectations are the root of unhappiness.', 'The carbonara did actually feature some sort of pancetta this time (huzzah!) but the sauce \xa0was scrambled again (boo!) and just too bland. The spaghetti marinara did consist of some choice bits of seafood, fresh calamari, clams, and tuna, but the sauce was devastatingly underwhelming. The flavour was absolutely one-dimensional, without even a smidgen of basil or oregano to perk up the tomato passata. After nibbling the best bits of seafood, I abandoned it and wearily returned to my prosecco. We left, considerably upset and wondering whether the P.T.S.D similarity was well-deserved.', "We saw a few people ordering pizzas there, and the restaurant has a lovely little woodbrick oven below, so perhaps a pizza next time would justify the visit. If you've already tried some, do let us know. Please also let us know if our experiences were absolute flukes, because it's unfathomable that a restaurant that shows such attention to detail otherwise could neglect its culinary offerings so badly.", "A firm disclaimer needs to be put out there too, that their pretty hand-written chalkboard signs outside that offer aperitivo cocktails like spritz and campari are premature exclamations since they don't have a liquor licence yet. So bring along a bottle of wine, enjoy the ambience, and order warily."]
user_reviews: ['\n                                            Desserts were the best part. As they own Il Gelato and the desserts looked really home made. I had a ricotta cake and it was delicious. My partner had duck and it was ok, also the gravy. But my gnocchi al gorgonzola was pretty horrible: the gnocchi was undercooked, literally you could see the flour inside still raw when you give it a bite. The gorgonzola was barely there, as it was drowning in a sea of fresh cream.', "\nIn Italy we say when you don't know how to cook a primo piatto just put a lot of panna….well this is what happened with my gnocchi al gorgonzola.", "\nIt seems they just opened (not sure) so I will give it a second try in a couple of months and see if they managed to  improve their cuisine. I had big expectations because I really liked their gelato and because they make a great Illy caffe'.", "\nPricewise I also think it was really overpriced for the quality of the food…I think you pay more for the area it's located than for the food.\n                                    ", '\n                                            Amazing service.

user_comments: ['\n\n                                    Dear Kinita, To set your expectation appropriately, benchmark it to the price you pay. ', '\nie. if all you are getting is supermarket ham and bland white sauce in your carbonara which you can get for Rs.400 from maybe a joint like Sensal, then you expect more from paying Rs.1050/= right?', "\nSo don't question your expectation. You expect your expectations when you walk in, if it doesn't - the place is plain baad (fullstop)\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    A great concept, with some quality ingredients, but needs improvement in the food. A restaurant pitching itself as a specialist in a regional style of cuisine has really nail the dishes, especially when the menu is tight & concise.', '\n', '\nGreat espresso coffee, served from Illy pods.', '\n', '\n"The gelato is supplied by Il Gelato, and the coffee is illy, an Italian staple."', '\nThe owners of this restaurant own Il Gelato, are the main franchisees for Illy coffee & illy branded machines and own the Italian restaurant in Battaramula, La Trattoria. Yamu needs to interact more with management & ownership of restaurants to do some research for the preamble to your reviews.', '\n', '\nThe place has great interior design, multiple dining spaces - bar stools down stairs in front of the deli/cheese room, espresso bar searing and tables and couches upstairs (lots of space between tables too).', '\n', '\nLove the fact they are air freighting the cheeses and cured meats from Italy - the quality of the salami & pancetta is easily the best in Colombo and PST serves up the best charcuterie platter.', '\n', '\nWood fired pizza oven is great in concept, but consistency of the pizzas needs improving (cooking level of the door varies too much, and I have had pizzas unevenly cooked).', '\n', '\nPastas have been mixed. Had a superb lasagna, but the carbonara was a lets down (sauce too watery, stingy with the imported pancetta). Pasta itself has been cooked well each time I tried it.', '\n', '\nFresh baked bread a nice touch, but again like the pizza dishes, inconsistently cooked on multiple visits…. sometimes overcooked & sometimes undercooked & doughy.', '\n', '\nWait times have been very slow at times with the bottle neck being the speed food is sent out from the kitchen. The wait staff have been quick and efficient with very good knowledge of the menu by the senior staff members.', '\n', "\nOne thing; they have constructed this very cool plate glass floor panel between the kitchen ceiling &5)3 upstairs dining room floor. This allows the waiter upstairs to see when a dish is ready on the pass for service to the tables and also for more visual interaction between chefs and floor staff. Unfortunately where this is located means, that (unless properly trained) the waiter basically dawdles in the middle of the dining room with his back turned to more than half the dining tables. A couple of waiters were able to flit past this glass floor panel without being obvious but most just hung around this area looking like a peeve at Majestic City. It's not a good look visually for the diner, but it does help with making food flow more efficiently between kitchen and dining room.", '\n', "\np.s. scrambled egg carbonara should have been returned to the kitchen both times. If an specialist Italian restaurant's chef can't get a carbonara right, might as well hang up the chefs apron.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    The charcuterie platter, is good, but not "easily the best". ', '\nThe new iL Ponte platter has better quality forest ham and spicy salami.', '\nThe platter at Santore wins because of the generous amount of prosciutto, the buffalo mozzarella and the bread etc', '\n', "\nNow why can't anyone serve up some 'Nduja instead of sweet chutney\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I tried the new Il Ponte platter 6 months ago, and it's awesome.

The first dish under 'The Upsetting' section is the soup which is given a whopping 10. So how can this be upsetting? It's a bad headline to use to summarise the second visit which should is more mixed than upsetting.  The second visit should have justified the trial of a pizza in order for this to be a more comprehensive review and should not have needed readers to submit their thoughts. And the 'Tip' should be something that the public may not know or figure out for themselves even having read the menu. Telling them that Il Geltao is available when customers can figure that out is a bit silly. The 'BYOB' would have been better placed in the Tip section. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Disappointed!

I ordered a pizza salami, but when it eventually came it was like a margherita with a couple of slices of COLD salami thrown on top. When I said I wanted the salami cooked (as normal in the pizza oven) they bought it back after 2 minutes with the salami now half cooked and the pizza edges too crispy from the extra time in the oven…!

The crust itself was quite crispy so there is no fault in the dough but I felt that the oven was not up to temperature when the pizza was being cooked, along with an unevenly rolled out pie to begin with.

You're an Italian restaurant, owned by an Italian, being run by an Italian restaurant manager (who drives a cute little Italian Car BTW, I'm jelly!)

My gripe is that something as basic as pizza has not been perfected here with each pie made love to, Italian Style. It should be the highlight of this restaurant because no matter how good the ingredients you fly in are, if the base that you're putting them on is not doing justice to it, you might as well land some of Cargills or Keells' finest and make a larger margin on your food sales. I mean being in Colombo, we’re kinda spoilt for choice when it comes to well made, tasty, thin crust pizza. So basically, why bother schlepping yourself all the way here, except to have that creamy goodness that is their Gelato?
