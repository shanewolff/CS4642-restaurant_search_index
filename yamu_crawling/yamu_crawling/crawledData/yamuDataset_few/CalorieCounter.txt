yamu_review: ["Calorie Counter with its emphasis on healthy eating was one of the best new additions to Colombo's restaurant scene in 2015. Recently, they also introduced a comprehensive breakfast menu, most of which actually tastes great.", 'Healthy eating has picked up a bit over the past few years thanks to the likes of ', ' and ', ". Calorie Counter joined the fray at the beginning of 2015 and impressed us quite a bit on our previous visit. Now, they also serve breakfast starting at 8 AM, with an entirely new menu that has a good variety of veg- and fruit-based dishes as well as options heavy in granola, muesli and oats. Unfortunately, healthy eating doesn't really come cheap so expect to pay anywhere between Rs. 500 - Rs. 1,000 depending on what you choose.", "If, like me, you're a fan of berry juices, the energy protein booster (Rs. 480) will likely make you very happy. It's a blend of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries with red rice milk. Don't expect this to be like a normal shake though, since there isn't any added sugar. There is, however, a decent amount of sweetness, all of which comes from the berries.", "The blueberry granola parfait (Rs. 450) is one of the new breakfast additions and it's quite tasty. Unlike the conventional dessert parfait which has cream, this one features curd layered with overnight soaked oats and blueberries. The yoghurt itself is not sweet, but the blueberries help in that aspect and the granola adds a nice bit of crunch.\xa0 This may seem like a small portion for Rs. 450 but that jar actually holds quite a bit. This is very filling by itself.\xa0", "The eggs Benedict (Rs. 650) was the main we chose and it ticked all the right boxes. We also like how they've modified the famous American breakfast dish to make it very healthy. They've pretty much replaced all the components, with smoked salmon being used instead of ham, bagels swapped for healthier multi-seed bread and a creamy avocado dressing replacing the hollondaise, all of it topped with a perfectly poached egg. You could argue that this is barely an eggs Benedict, but we found it be pretty close in terms of flavour.\xa0", "Despite the fact that I was pretty stuffed at this point, I also got their nutri breakfast (Rs. 650) to go. We've received a few complaints about their delivery and takeaway not being up to scratch, but we ran into no such issues. This is basically a fruity breakfast with oats. The oats were pretty standard but the fruits were the real winner here.\xa0", "Counter is like a small health food cafe. It has room for around 15 diners, but their location at Thimbirigasyaya Junction is very accessible. They've taken some cues from fast food joints and displayed their menu items on the walls with the relevant calorie count for each dish. All in all, it's quite simple but works quite nicely with their theme.", 'Service at Calorie Counter is also top-notch and very personal. On our first visit, the chef came around to our table to ask how our meal was, so we were glad to see him still doing the same nearly six months later.', "We're really glad to see that Calorie Counter has upheld the high standards they set for themselves at the beginning of the year. They're also one of the only places to offer a breakfast menu with a focus on health food, so we really hope this kicks off.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Calorie Counter with its emphasis on healthy eating was one of the best new additions to Colombo's restaurant scene in 2015.

Opening the container and finding the corn was a bit like finding that extra present under the Christmas tree.', '\r\n', '\r\nThe last few visits to Calories Counter have been a disappointment to say the least. The potions sizes have been ludicrously inconsistent.  A rather piss poor show, if you ask me, for a restaurant that brands itself as eatery where an overweight chap (or "chapette") can control his/her calorie intake. The grilled chicken was dry and tasteless and that lovely pumpkin mash reduced to a watery mush like Top Gear without Clarkson, May and Hammond.', '\r\n', '\r\nIt is indeed sad. Sad, sad sad (or bow wow wow as Snoop Dogg would say). I was a big fan of the Calorie Counter. I do hope the owners will take this review seriously as they had a fantastic product.

Went today and left severely underwhelmed. The pineapple colada was fantastic, no complaints there. The steak, on the other hand, was a mess. Basically, they don't seem to understand the difference between rare/medium/well done. As we were waiting to get our meal, another table complained about this. My wife and I ordered one rare steak and one medium - both were cooked well-done. The sweet potato mash was obviously just microwaved, with little to no seasoning. The veggies were okay, but again lacked seasoning, and there was just one leaf of spinach… Bit of a laugh. Prices are fine, but there needs to be a big step up in quality I feel. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    That's unfortunate, since the food was  very good on the day we went.

We understand that you have ordered two rib eye steaks and a Pineapple Colada on this particular day. Please be assured that we have taken corrective measures with regard to the steak, and will make sure that such unfortunate experiences do not recur in future. With regard to the comments on seasoning, the reduced amount of salt that we use on our seasoning to keep to the healthy output may have had an effect on this instance. The portion sizes have been measured and standardized to keep the calorie count in tact. Let me apologize once again on behalf of the Calorie Counter team.
