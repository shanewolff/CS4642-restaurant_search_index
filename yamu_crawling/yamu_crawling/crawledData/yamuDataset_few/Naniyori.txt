excerpt: Naniyori is good value for money.  Decent dine-in at Nawala and best sushi delivery in Colombo. 
yamu_review: ["We love Naniyori for their bento box delivery service that's not the fastest but still good value for money. They've got a dine-in restaurant at the Steamboat premises in Nawala, and it's actually a really nice place for lunch. We fell in love with the katsudon, and really enjoyed the karage chicken, too. If you live or work around the area, there's no reason not to dine here. It might not be the best Japanese in town, but it's certainly close enough.", '\n', '\n', "There's quite a lot to choose from, from sushi, nigiri, sashimi and their bento boxes, all priced somewhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1500, so it's pretty affordable. We started off with the Gyoza (Rs. 520), i.e. pork dumplings, and we weren't blown away. You can get much better value for money at Min Han, where they serve you 10 dumplings for Rs. 300. Here, you get 6. To be fair, the dumplings at Naniyori are less oily.", '\n', '\n', "There's a live action station, so you can actually watch your sushi being prepared.", '\n', "\nFor sushi, we tried the Tekka Maki (Rs. 690). You get 12 pieces, and the tuna tastes pretty fresh.\xa0Though they are quite generous with the wasabi, there's a notice on the table that discourages customers from overdoing it. We couldn't find much fault with the sushi.", "Super crisp and moist in the inside, the Chicken Karage (Rs. 590) was quite good. You get about 6 pieces, so it's enough for two to three people.", "The real winner though is the Pork Katsudon (Rs. 720). Served hot-hot, this is quite a feast in a bowl. The egg is cooked just right, being just lightly runny, and the pork adds so much depth to the flavours going on here. The onions are lightly caramelized and everything just works really well with the rice. Two people could share one of these, but it's really good if you gorge on it by yourself, indulging in your gluttony.", "They don't have too much on offer when it comes to beverages. There's a few juices, so we tried the Watermelon (Rs. 150) and it was just okay. A little watery and sweet.", '\n', '\n', "They've got a few different brands of Sake. We tried the Kiipon\xa0(Rs. 300) and it was alright. You get 50ml. They do have a bar at Naniyori, though, with a tv set to a sports channel, so we'll be checking that out on our next visit.", "We quite liked the mood that's set once you walk into the place. It's quite calm and the dark wood and white backdrop lends a peaceful vibe to the place. There's some private booths as well if you want to sit on the floor, or the regular table and chair scene.\xa0", "Oh, and there's also these cards that encourage you to talk to each other and not get glued to the phone, and some facts about Japan for kids. We like Naniyori at Steamboat. The food is pretty good and the prices are fairly reasonable. If you live or work around the area, this might be the best Japanese fix. For the best value for money, though, try the bento boxes. Their delivery is not too bad either.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Great value for money.

They're also the only place that does Japanese delivery, as far as we know. As part of the complex that houses Steamboat and Ace Pub, it's also not bad for dining in.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Naniyori is good value for money.
