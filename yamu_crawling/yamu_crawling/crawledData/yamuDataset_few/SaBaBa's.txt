excerpt: SaBaBa's is basically the only place on Whiskey Point. It's run by Mambo's brother and is pretty chill. It's underground (no website/Facebook/etc), but if you show up they'll serve you.

address: Whiskey Point, Arugam Bay, Eastern Province 
directions: It's a bit of a trek. You'd need to take a trishaw past Pottuvil town, continue on the main road till you see lagoon on your left, then take a right and head towards the beach.
