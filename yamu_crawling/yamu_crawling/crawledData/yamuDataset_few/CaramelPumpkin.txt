name:  Caramel Pumpkin
excerpt: The newest cafe in Cinnamon Gardens to enjoy some delicious pasta and huge slices of cheesecakes.
yamu_review: ["Ever since Caramel Pumpkin opened up on Wijerama Mawatha, we've been seeing ridiculously cute Instagram posts about the place and the food. We finally paid them a visit for a first look.", 'Their menu is pretty much what you\'d expect at a modern Colombo cafe, except that they\'ve managed to put up some catchy names for their dishes and drinks like "You Got a Beef with Me?" "Ragin\' Cajun", "One Night in Bangkok", etc. Along with their selection of contemporary Western dishes, they\'ve also got range of cheesecakes (bake and no-bake), apple pies, cakes, muffins, and cookies which they\'ll usually have on display.', "We started off with a Mamma Mia (Rs. 750) which is from their pasta range. The great thing about this is that you can customize it (pasta + sauce + protein + topping), which is something we haven't come across in our cafes. We chose the roast chicken penne pesto pasta with oregano and chili flakes. It was absolutely delicious. Slightly al dante\xa0with a well-seasoned pesto sauce, the pasta was an absolute treat with the thinly sliced chicken and the toppings giving it an added kick.", "I was really excited to try the Quesadillas (Rs. 680)... but it sadly\xa0didn't deliver. I tried the vegetarian option, which could have benefitted from a bit more variety in terms of veges. The filling inside only had bell pepper, corn, and lots and lots of mozzarella. While the tortillas had a nice subtle crunch to them, the overabundance of mozzy meant the quesadillas fell apart as we ate them. That being said, a few more veges and a bit less mozzarella could improve this overnight.", "Being suckers for cheesecake, Vishvi and I couldn't help eyeing these massive slices on display. The Blueberry Cheesecake (Rs. 450) was a whopping slice for such a reasonable price. We really hope they stick to it because I can safely say you will not get a better deal anywhere else. The cream cheese filling was not as dense as the one we had at ", ', but it was still rich and creamy with a light biscuit base. The blueberry coulis, however, was way too sweet for our taste (your mileage may vary). A bit less sweetness would really help the sourness of the bluberries also come through, and really bring the entire dish together.', 'Their drinks have the same catchy titles like the food such as, Like a Boss, The Girl Next Door, Old Faithful etc. They have all your favorite coffees, along with fresh juices, cold drinks, milkshakes and iced teas.', "We tried the Like a Boss (Rs. 650) which is their signature drink. Since the blurb didn't mention what it was, we didn't really know what to expect. It was basically a frappe with fresh milk, caramel, and whipped cream. The drink itself is very milky which appeal some more than others, but we would have liked to have tasted a bit more caramel coming through.", "We also tried My Girlfriend's Girlfriend (Rs. 650) which is their Belgian Hot Chocolate. They have used some great Belgian chocolate because the strong chocolate aroma was undeniable. Unfortunately, the texture was quite watery with very little milk added. If the drink was creamier, it would have been a treat.", 'The\xa0staff is lively, attentive and very friendly. Their service is very efficient as our food arrived within 10-15 minutes.\xa0', 'I was instantly drawn to the cozy atmosphere of the place. It is everything you want in a cafe; spacious, peaceful and comfortable. They have three floors (third one still under renovations we believe) each decorated with framed quotes and artsy paintings. The seating arrangements have quite the variety from cushioned chairs, booths, wooden benches and high chairs to bean bags.', 'They also have a beautiful outdoor section, overlooking the street and it is perfect for an evening coffee date.', "It's a great place to hang out and enjoy some pasta and coffee, but the only thing that stood out on our first (unrated) visit was the pasta. They have just started out, so we would hope they can improve on their dishes in the coming months. It's a nice location and already buzzing so we have high hopes.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A cafe that has customizable pasta and massive slices of cheesecake.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    කෝපි එකක් තොලගගා කයියක් ගහන්න නරක තැනකුත් නෙවෙයි මෙතන.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    කොළඹ හත වගේ තැනකින් රු. 1000කට වගේ කෑම වේලක් කන්න පුළුවන් කියන්නේ සෑහෙන්න දෙයක්.\n                                                                                                                            ']

The ‘Thai green curry(chicken) with steamed rice’ was absolutely bland and lacked any kind of spice. There was no intense green curry flavor and nooo accompaniment such as a Thai style salad or even something simple and spicy like a chille paste. I wouldn’t recommend eating mains there.\n                                    ', '\n                                            Terrible Service with Very average food & drinks. A good location wasted on a restaurant that doesn’t care about its customers. My Dinner took 50 minutes to reach the table from the time of order! I only ordered Fish & Chips which was very average in taste & presentation. For 40 minutes I politely sat there sipping my drink & spoke to a  waiter who took my bill (with the time mentioned) & asked me to give him a minute but passed by in 5 without even looking in my direction & pretending not to hear me when I called out. Having made a fuss to another waiter I finally got in after 50 minutes. A good dish could have made up for that time, but it didn’t qualify. Waited for an apology, didn’t get one. Asked for the Manager who never turned up. We didn’t wanna sit at that place wasting any more time so left soon after & that’s why I’m writing this review. Utterly Disappointed.
