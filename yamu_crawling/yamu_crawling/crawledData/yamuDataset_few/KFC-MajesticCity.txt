Sometimes even the tables don't get cleaned properly allowing pieces of chicken left for the next set of customers.! ", '\r\n', '\r\nI have not seen the same in the other outlets fortunately.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    The food here is often served cold… I've often asked them to reheat or serve me something else… on a side note, is the Twister supposed to be cold??\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I have been to several KFC outlets. yeah the cleanliness is not good as MC. Nugegoda is the worst one. and their customer service is awful. but still i love to taste KFC chicken. that is the only reason. MC is damn crowded and very unpleasant. even they dont have proper washrooms. palawaththa branch is sort of good since it is new. ', '\r\nand there is a hidden KFC in wellawatta, which remains in a good condition. and i have to say something about the new crushers. it is just a waste of money.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Yes, cleanliness is an issue especially with the MC KFC outlet. And the AC there is not good enough to sustain the crowds, often even when the place is even half full, you can feel stuffy and start sweating waiting for your turn at the queue.', '\r\n', '\r\nI also think the quality of service at the counter has gone downhill. It is now common for them to make mistakes in the order, not give enough tissues, serve food cold and sometimes being a bit rude too. All they seem to be is just appearing as if they were busy. I only go to drive thru places in Rajagiriya KFC now.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    There's a recurring theme in almost every KFC I've been to - AWFUL service.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Now they have started to charge 150LKR delivery fee, regardless of the total amount or distance. That is awful and even the KFC delivery guy told me that it is totally unfair… Prices have also been increase for new year… :/\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Never mind KFC MC, the one next to Access in Colombo once had a mouse running rather gleefully from one corner to another. The people who work there watched while i screamed and did nothing about it!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have read most of the comments above and it all points to the same. Hygiene, I agree with that. Most of the time I wonder why would people even turn up to these places nowadays. I used to work at KFC once for the period of 6 months. During that time we were trained to keep the tables and a lobby area always clean. Cant really remember how many time we used to clean the table with in the day. But there were lot of coordination and strict supervision. But I think the standards have gone down. Specially when you hear that cold food is been served, it was not at all suppose to be like. French Fried and Chicken have their time which you can keep in the showcase. After a while they are suppose to dumped in the bin as that was part KFC policy back then.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    MC KFC is just filthy- which just ridiculous for such an over priced joint. The food too is often of a poor standard with oily putrid tasting chicken- the Biriyani is the worst of the lot! Its worse than a 100 buck bat-packet! Ronald rocks though!  \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    why they don't have Original Recipe?\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    If you really Wanna Rate KFC in Sri lanka You Should Try KFC Moratuwa. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The size of Krushers in SL is pretty hilarious when you compare them with what other countries have\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Seriously disgusted by the last meal i had from KFC Nugegoda! It was abysmal! the chicken skin has this weird smell of old oil and there was no seasoning in the batter plus the coleslaw smelled really bad, like there was something wrong with the mayo… ugh never again :S\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    KFC Ja-Ela is not good at all. Couple of times I found that teh rice in KFC buriyani was not cooked properly and the chicken pieces were pink in color which meant it has not been fried properly. And what more they charge Rs. 150 for delivery!!!!!!!!\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    KFC is the crappiest international food join in the country, they really don't know what they are doing, since last promotion I have stopped going there. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I agree with pooh.

So they have to be abide by some rules and regulations of the franchiser which I think is the reason behind making them refrain from becoming more localized. I have been to this place a number of times. I actually didn't look at the hygienic factor (my bad), but I had a bad service experience here.", '\r\n', "\r\nWent during the lunch hour of a week day and wanted to have my lunch quickly and go away. There was a queue in extreme right corner with one Muslim lady. i joined it and I was the next. the guy at the counter said the counter is closed while it was my turn. I asked then how come you serve that lady. He said they gave her special attention since she carried a baby. I didn't like the way he treated me as a customer. He just harshly closed the counter. I forgot to tell him that next time I would wear a frock so that he would open a closed counter and serve me as a special case!", '\r\n', '\r\nAs I was totally unhappy with the service I sent a complaint email to Cargills who is the franchisee.

Now I usually go only to McDonalds, even though I prefer the food at KFC simply because McDonalds service is much better. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The food is served cold and lots of flies… the worst KFC in the world…\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Haven't been to KFC @ MC recently but the last two occasions I ate from KFC Jawatte Road gave me severe food poisoning. The first time I thought it was simply a passing incident, but when you get it twice in a row, then there is something wrong. I am contemplating whether I should give the PHI a call…. :(\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Maharagama KFC is such a disaster. The cashier girl "Kanchana" such an attitude as if we are asking food for free. Takes such a long time to attend to a customer. Not even a smile on the face. The tables are unclean and it takes such a long time for a waiter to come and clean the tables. Waiters drags the chairs and tables all over making such a huge noise. Not a single blinds. The customers have to eat food in the sun. No AC or a single fan. If we want these types of unfriendly, noisy place to eat we wont be going for KFC.
