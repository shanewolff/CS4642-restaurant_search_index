name: Palm Strip (At The Airport)
excerpt: This has long been among the most exciting restaurants in the city. Not because of its cutting edge cuisine but because, for years, this was the only place to eat at Katunayake (BIA) airport. So a meal at the Palm Strip meant you were going places.

The lack of competition earlier has made them utterly complacent. In my view your review of this place is far fa r too generous.", '\r\n', "\r\nI'd quite sincerely, and whole-heartedly urge people to check out the other options; Coffee Bean,", "\r\nBarista or this place which isn't bad from my experience, it's a tourist shop/cafe I can't recall the name!. Zesta maybe? .\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    On one level I agree. I mean this isnt great food or anything - but, maybe its nostalgia/ the general relief of being able to sit down a breathe between the rush or check-in and boarding, but I enjoy the Palm Strip.   I think you might be right about that cafe (at the back by the gates?) I'll give that a more thorough review when I next get a chance. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Palm Strip's hot chocolates have always been lukewarm. May be I never caught them on the right day. Spaghetti usually bland, and again, not pipping hot. Zesta tea shop, gives better service and pipping hot brew, microwaved food. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Frankly, this place needs a revamp. The service was abysmal. I once dined here, but would never go there again. My wife and I waited more than 20 min to get our meal, that too after asking them few times. The small cafe next to the bookshop has a better service.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The best place in the Airport is the executive lounges. I was last @ Araliya lounge and enjoyed it. Good ambiance, good food and drinks. \n                                            ']
