yamu_review: ["Over the past couple of years, Sugar Bistro & Wine Bar at The Crescat Boulevard has become an increasingly popular hang out spot in Colombo. They've got fairly good food with plenty of variety, a chic and classy setting and some of the most enthusiastic service we've experienced.", "Sugar Bistro's main draw lies in the fact that they offer a lot of variety, depending on the occasion, whether it be a casual meet-up for drinks or even something more formal. Their menu offers a good range of options for salads, tapas and sandwiches along with their mains and desserts. They've also got a more than respectable selection of cocktails, spirits and of course wines. Pricing is a bit tricky here, so the cost per head could deviate greatly depending on what you get and how many courses you go for. One thing we noted was that the prices of mains were quite reasonable ranging between Rs. 850 - Rs. 2000, but the salads in comparison were quite expensive.", '\xa0', 'For dessert we tried out their lemongrass panna cotta with lychee crumble (Rs. 475), though it probably should have been worded more along the lines of "w/ crumble and lychees". Lemongrass isn\'t a mainstream dessert ingredient but it actually worked quite brilliantly with this one. The panacotta was was creamy and rich with the lemongrass flavour coming through without being too overpowering. The crumble and lychee topping also combined quite well, resulting in a nice contrast between the three textures.', "We liked Sugar Bistro in the past and three years down the line that still hasn't changed.

If you consider those 300-rupee excuses for breakfasts down south, with retoasted toast and dry scrambled eggs, this was great value. I also optimistically tried the mini cordon bleu, and I agree, that's a waste of time.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I love sugar too and I did a review of the place as well ', "  You seem to have forgotten to mention the excellent service because it really is noteworthy.

Would like to see an improvment to the breakfast menu (mostly because the burgers are so good in comparision).  Staff is pretty attentive and jovial but there are definity lapses in the ranks as items get left off with certain waiters.  All in all a great hangout for a small crew or family dinner.
