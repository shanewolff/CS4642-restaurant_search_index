excerpt: A vegetarian friendy place for all your Indian sweet tooth cravings. 
yamu_review: ['Moksha serves a wide range of Indian food (such as North Indian snacks and Delhi\xa0Chaat, a range of breads, rice dishes and even quirky things like a Paneer Burger). It also features\xa0a respectabe range of sweets (their speciality is the kulfi) that seem great value for money.\u200b', 'Located near to the end of Duplication Rd, Moksha\xa0screams at you with its light-blue themed branding. Parking is tough to find along this stretch of the road, so be warned.\xa0', 'Despite the tacky decor, the food is presented really well. More importantly, the food tasted\xa0pretty good too.', 'We started with some chaat. The Dahi Puri (Rs. 350) and Aloo Samosa (Rs. 250), both were well worth the money and could have been full meals in and of themselves.', "Both of them wavered on the sweet side, with no choice being offered to make them spicy, which is normal procedure when it comes to chaat. We added some spicy sauce into them, but it honestly didn't do much.\xa0", "Next we went for the thali (Rs. 1250), great value for money. It came with aloo paratha,\xa0mushroom mutter, paneer masala and dhal makani, with a generous helping of vegetable biryani. The parata was excellent and contained a generous dose of spicy potatoes on the inside.\xa0The curries weren't too spicy and complemented each other really well.", 'The vegetable biryani, a little bland in the begining, soon acquired taste\xa0and spice as it was mixed in with the curries. The thali came with a set of solid pickles and other accompaniments such as raita and papadum and the glass of buttermilk was\xa0just\xa0sour enough to taste good without being offputting.\xa0', 'It also comes with gulab jamun (the sauce was a little too sweet) and almond\xa0barfi (which was good). The thali is easily enough for two.', "Note that if you're a big fan of curry, and like to ladle it on in juicy quantities to eat with your parata or rice, then the quantity provided in the thali might be just south of sufficient.\xa0", "The Kulfi here is some of the most heavily marketed I have encountered. A huge LCD screen treats you to a 'making-of' video on this North Indian ice-cream-esque sweet on loop, to a soundtrack of Shah Rukh Kahn hits. We had to try it. Note: we went back the next day because space constraints in the belly.", "They sell Kulfi to walk-in customers, in little packets (from Rs. 100) to little clay pots (Rs. 450 onwards depending on the flavor), which was the classic packaging the maharajahs would eat it out of. The quantity isn't huge, and you can probably buy much more ice-cream for the same price, but for the same prices as a couple of scoops of decent ice-cream from a decent deli, the kulfi offers you a taste sensation that is hard to find anywhere else here in SL.\xa0", "That being, said, it didn't come off as being the best. All of the flavors we tried had something missing. The Roasted Almond something I\xa0couldn't quite put my finger on, but it lingered after i'd swallowed, driving me nuts. The Matka Kesar Almond Pistachio was much better, but perhaps a tad too much cardamom in it? It was my favourite though. The Mango Maaza was a little to soft and gooey, and the mango tasted a little artificial.", "I'd suggest sticking to the traditional spice and nuts based flavors and stay away from the fruity ones (they have a range going from mangoostein to rambutan).", 'The ambience inside is mystifyingly quirky. The chairs and tables are of varying different styles and shapes, like it was all put together from an\xa0auction or garage sale.\xa0Our table even had a drawer (in case you want to keep bits of food inside for later?)', 'The decor was similarly eclectic. Wooden Sigiri tapestry replicas clash with\xa0nineties birthday party decor, all while bright\xa0peices of cotton adorn every surface in celebration of christmas.', "In one corner there was an 'art gallery'\xa0full of kids' artwork.\xa0Right below them a set of large trash cans were\xa0passing all sorts of passive aggressive and not so constructive critique on\xa0the art of these poor kids.\xa0", 'The staff are efficient, but surprisingly also, very shy. Questions had to be repeated and they gave us goggle eyes when one of us rolled a cigarette. The payment system is pay-before-you-eat. You order your food and then pay at the counter, cafeteria style.', "Moksha serves a lot of Indian food, highlights being the chaat and thali.\xa0\xa0The ambience doesn't exactly inspire a calm and sophisticated feeling, but if you're only here to stuff your face, I\xa0am sure you can let that go.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Moksha serves a wide range of Indian food (such as North Indian snacks and Delhi\xa0Chaat, a range of breads, rice dishes and even quirky things like a Paneer Burger).\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    It is a great place for your Indian dessert cravings.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හිත ගියේ මෝක්ෂා ‘ප්\u200dරෝන් බිරියානි’ එකට වුණාට මොකද වේටර් මල්ලිගෙන් අහල බැලින්නම් ඒවා ගන්න නෑ. දවසෙ අවුලද මන්දා, කියල හිතින් බැණබැණ ආයෙත් මෙනුව බලපු මම වෙජි, පනීර් බිරියානි එකක් ඕඩර් කළා.\n                                                                                                                            ']
