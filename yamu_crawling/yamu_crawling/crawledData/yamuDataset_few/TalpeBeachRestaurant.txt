So if you are thinking of ditching the pizzas & trying something new, fear not, this is a great bet and well worth the visit!', '\r\n', '\r\nThe location is fabulous as it’s a villa and unlike Wijeya you have plenty of space including parking on site and no feeling that your stuff might get taken by random beach walkers! You are set away from the beach overlooking it and intimately close to the sea. There is plenty of seating possible and these guys do take reservations.', '\r\n', '\r\nThe pool makes for a great alternative although there is a fantastic swimming beach just mins walk around the left corner. You can even snorkel there.', '\r\n', '\r\nYou see giant sea turtles bobbing in and out of the water right in front of the restaurant and you’d wish you could swim out to them if it weren’t for the massive reef! You get some amazing foto opps with water smashing on the reef as well.  If you go more to the right of the beach you can see some colorful fish too.', '\r\n', '\r\nAfter we soaked in the location we got on the lunch mission! For our first round we ordered the Tuna Tartare reviewed by Yamu and the seafood soup. These were well made and great flavors simply put – quite large in size too. Then we got the coral reef fish grilled and a club sandwich for mains. Both were fantastic – the fish undeniably fresh & cooked to perfection soft, flaky and moist. The accompanying sauce was unreal with a bite to it and the right levels of soy and lime. The sandwich was massive, more like a sub, and each bite refreshingly flavorful and juicy. They make the bread in-house so no wonder that bread was fabulous! They also grow their own herbs onsite!', '\r\n', '\r\nA few drinks kept the afternoon going when we opted for an early desert! Feeling slightly peckish we got the waffles and the brownie. These deserts were dangerously generous portions enough to share with massive waffles and a chunky nutty brownie – do ask for extra syrup for the waffles as you will need it. This decision turned out to have been a good one when it came to dinner time!', '\r\n', '\r\nThe generous portions are the norm at Talpe Beach! For dinner we had the aptly named ‘big’ pork chop, repeat of the coral reef fish and a lentil soup. The soup was nicely seasoned and filling. The mains come with two side choices and enough options to choose from! The pork chop was a highlight – it was a very high quality generous piece and the grilling was nicely done to a level so there was a slight burn on the fat but keeping the white meat not overdone. Each bite was heavenly needless to say and I am a believer that there can be good chops in Sri Lanka! The pork is sourced farm direct, hence the quality. There was no room left for desert after this feast!', '\r\n', '\r\nThe service at Talpe beach is nothing short of amazing and it all starts with the on-site management and their commitment.  The German husband (chef) and wife couple are intimately involved in their business and make it a point to interact with guests and make sure they are well taken care of. The food is obviously fantastic because a professional chef is making all of your meals in a very clean kitchen – you are genuinely getting what you pay for here! The head waitstaff was trained in Dubai and knows service inside and out in how to please guests. The other servers are also very cordial and attentive – they could use a few more servers but I’m sure that will happen. You are in exceptional hands at Talpe beach and it is miles apart from what you get at Wijeya beach for similar prices less the bad attitude.', '\r\n', '\r\nTalpe beach doenst discriminate whether you are a local or a foreigner and treats you well as a customer. You don’t have to know someone here to ensure you get the right service as everyone is treated equally well. This is coming from the international minded managers who believe in this kind of philosophy and their prime focus being to delight all customers with exceptional food at their wonderful location. ', '\r\n', '\r\nIf you are a discerning beach visitor from Colombo you can’t go wrong with Talpe beach for the beach, for a pool, great food and for excellent service. This spot is kid friendly from what we saw since you can keep an eye on them and the pool makes for great kids fun. A day spent here is a day well spent!', '\r\n\n                                            ']
