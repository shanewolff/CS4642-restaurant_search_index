name: Sen Saal (Battaramulla)
excerpt: Sen Saal was one of the very first large scale bakeries to establish themselves in Battaramulla. Since then they have added a restaurant at the back where they serve things like Lasgna, Rice and Curry, Nasi Goreng, Fried Rice and even the elusive Lamprais. They also do submarines and fresh fruit juices. Having lived in Battaramulla for so many years now, I was excited about writing a good review to rep the town. But oh my god, this is going to be the furthest thing from a good review!

The problem is all the food is pre-cooked and served in an AC area. Therefore the food feels dry and pale cold. Had to ask for the food to be take for a spin in the oven, but then its like having leftovers at home. If ur in a long drive and in a rush looking for a stop to merely fill your tummy in a relaxing surrounding this is the place. Other than that dont make a trip just for dinner at sen-sal.
