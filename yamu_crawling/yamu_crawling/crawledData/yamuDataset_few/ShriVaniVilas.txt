name: Shri Vani Vilas
excerpt: This saivar kade does some killer dishes and has earned street cred for being the best in Colombo.
yamu_review: ['More commonly known as Vani Vilas, Shri Vani Vilas has been around for a couple of generations and has a reputation for being one of the best—if not\xa0', '—saivars around. They have a huge range of food\xa0on offer, from your regular ', ' and ', ', to more elaborate dishes such as the tandoori platter, mushroom pepper fry, and Lucknowi dum biryani. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and make you feel right at home.', 'There is\xa0an upstairs and downstairs section. The\xa0downstairs is your regular, fast-paced ', '\xa0which is perfect for the working crowd in a hurry, while\xa0the upstairs is more like a proper restaurant for families and kids. We dined upstairs, in the airconditioned restaurant.\xa0', "Their staff are warm—like people you've known for ages—while also being professional.\xa0They are caring and concerned about\xa0whether you enjoyed the food,\xa0and also urge you to tuck into some of the dishes while they are still hot.\xa0(They were also keen on helping me with photographing the food).", 'Now, to get down to the food. We began our meal with regular fare like the ', ' and ghee roast.\xa0\xa0', "This vadai (Rs. 60) \xa0is hands down one of the best I've tried. There are\xa0few places that get this fluffy doughball right.\xa0Vani Villas hits the spot by frying the\xa0", '\xa0to crisp, golden perfection. Piping hot, the ', '\xa0was soft and moist on the insides and wonderful to bite into.', 'The ghee roast (Rs. 240)\xa0was beautifully presented, but slighty doughy on the inside and not up to the standard of the crispy thin\xa0ghee roast at ', '.', "The hot and sour soup\xa0looked\xa0intensely spicy, but it was lacking in heat. It also had an off-putting consistency, having been thickened with corn flour.\xa0It wasn't bad overall, and fragnant from the leeks and bits of herbs that had been added to it, but it didn't live up to its name either.\xa0", 'Their honey chilli potatoes were a bit of a surprise because we were expecting potatoes and got fries instead.\xa0But the caramelised and lightly syrupy fries sprinkled with chilli powder and chopped spring onion greens, made the dish very interesting.\xa0', 'Garnished with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds, this was a taste that grew on you with every bite.\xa0', 'The Lucknow Dum Biryani was surprisingly good as well, with fragrant grains of basmati rice and fried onions on top.\xa0It almost melted in your mouth, and was packed with subtle flavour.', 'This was good, but everything paled in comparision to the Tandoori Platter, which at a mere Rs. 650 was the most expensive dish of the day.\xa0Presented on a sizzling and spluttering platter, it came as a very pleasant surprise.', 'It was generously laden with paneer (both tandoori and non-tandoori grilled paneer), and a plethora of fruits and greens (tangy pineapple, bell peppers, broccoli and lettuce).', "All of them were grilled just right — charred perfectly on the outside, and moist and soft inside.\xa0I'm no paneer expert,\xa0but that tandoori paneer was the best I've ever had. The stewards were kind enough to show me how to cut it up as well, although I'm sure I would have succeeded if I had tried it myself\xa0\xa0:D", "I was almost about to give Vani Vilas\xa0a five-star rating, had it not been for the soup and the overly sweet drinks we tried.\xa0This little restaurant whips up some amazing food in its unlikely location on\xa0busy and heavily industrialized Armour Street. It's a little jewel in that area, and well-worth visiting."]

The menu is slightly different and the ambience more so,  but it has always been the best place in Colombo for this food.
