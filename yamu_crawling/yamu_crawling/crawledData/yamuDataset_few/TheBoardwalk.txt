It used to be much better sometime back, probably because they had a better management. But yes, the foods mediocre and it wasn't even warm when it got to the table.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I hardly recommend this place to people who like to spend their time and relax. don't listen to any opinion before you go to that place and feel the ambiance.", '\r\nGREAT PLACE!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    We went here a few days ago and we were all so very disappointed.The food selection was few in number and the price in comparison was not value for money.The fresh juices are 450 Rs. which in my opinion is rather high.You can get awesome fresh juice at places like cross roads for half the price.However the nasigoreng(700 Rs) and hot stuff(800 Rs) were ok,but the egg fried rice was just dull and dry(700 Rs).The cheese and tomato sandwich priced at 550 was the only value for money item(in my opinion) out of the main dishes.The service was poor and we had to wait for a good 5 minutes for someone to notice us and one attendant nearly made us change our reserved table saying it wasnt the one when earlier the manager showed us the very same table ,last but not least the band made us cringe.Met only one guy who was warm and welcoming,rest were just high up in the air.We had so much expectations since waters edge has great service and food but sadly NOT recommending this place!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    It sucks how Yamu staff deletes comments.
