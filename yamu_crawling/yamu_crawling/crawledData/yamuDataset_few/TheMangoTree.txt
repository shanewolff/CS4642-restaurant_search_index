yamu_review: ["The Mango Tree down Dharmapala Road boasts of authentic North Indian cuisine. For the most part, it doesn't disappoint.\xa0YAMU ", " this place in early 2013, and it didn't win too many accolades back then, mostly due to crappy service. We figured that a place could change a lot\xa0in two years, and decided it was time to check it out again\xa0— and we were happily not let down.", 'We walked in for lunch, and it was more than half-packed even though it was a weekday. As luck would have it, there were about two tables free, and we were ushered towards them as\xa0soon as we walked in. We were then presented with the menu and a basket of complimentary ', '.', '.', 'The stewards were efficient and service was quite fast. We received our orders within 15\xa0minutes. A single portion at Mango Tree\xa0is more than sufficient\xa0for two people (including the soups).\xa0We started off with the soup, a chicken shorba (Rs. 450).\xa0', "We really liked the chicken shorba because of how flavoursome it was. The consistency was thick and somewhat creamy, while also being subtly spicy at the same time. The heat hits\xa0you really slowly, so your mouth kind of waters for\xa0a few minutes after you've\xa0finished slurping it up.", "According to the description on the menu, the dum aloo punjabi (Rs. 795) had\xa0whole potatoes stuffed with onions, cottage cheese\xa0and vegetables, and cooked in an onion gravy. This dish was heavy and sweet, and 'onion gravy' isn't really as weird as it sounds. The onions didn't have that overpowering smell or taste.\xa0We had this both with the\xa0", "(Rs. 250)\xa0and with the steamed Basmati rice (Rs. 425), and it paired really well with both.\xa0As you can see in the photo below, the potatoes were drowned in the oniony paste. This is definitely one of the better vegetarian dishes I've tasted for the sheer amount of flavour in it, and I'd recommend it even though it's on the pricey end of the spectrum.\xa0\xa0", "The chicken tikka masala (Rs. 975) was also delicious, but I think it was a bit too expensive for the amount of meat in it. If I recall correctly, there were only about five\xa0little pieces of chicken, and we would have liked more\xa0(especially since that dish alone came up to nearly a thousand\xa0bucks). Although it looked red and hot, this dish wasn't spicy.\xa0We liked it, but I personally didn't think it's worth it. Notwithstanding the meat, though, the\xa0gravy was a generous portion that\xa0could probably have served about four people.", "We don't have pictures of the drinks, a fresh papaya juice (Rs. 450) and masala tea (Rs. 295), but both of them fared well.\xa0The papaya juice tasted fresh and\xa0wasn't too watery\xa0or too thick.\xa0It practically tasted like a papaw itself. I loved the masala chai though, and it was definitely worth the price given that there were more than two teacups full of tea in the pot.", "Service was pretty fast and the stewards were good. Some of them seem rather young and new, and\xa0lacking a bit of confidence, but they did their job efficiently, serving the food the first time around and clearing the plates as soon as we were done.\xa0(In one humorous instance, the steward spooned rice on to my plate and then walked off, making my friend wonder about gender equality).\xa0The ambience is one of an upscale restaurant. The seating arrangements are a bit too crowded-in for my liking, and they could be spaced out a bit better, but overall it's a pretty nice place. It's an\xa0expensive restaurant, frequented by many foreigners.\xa0", "The Mango Tree whips up some pretty nice dishes, especially of the vegetarian kind. The flavours feel (and most probably are) authentic, with an underpinning\xa0of cinnamon, garlic, cloves, cardamom\xa0and other spices, as opposed to the flat and generic taste you get in\xa0most other places. They also serve really nice masala tea. The prices are somewhat expensive though, and don't include taxes and the service charge.", '\xa0', '\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Mango Tree is one of the better (and more popular) Indian joints out there, specialising in North Indian cuisine.

The quality of their fare has dropped to a point where you feel ripped off when the bill arrives.

My wife called there and was really unhappy over the way the telephone operator has answered her reservation request. He had basically sounded like it is the only place left in the whole world for us to have dinner. I don't know about their food, being in the hospitality and food business, they don't really know how to serve customers. I don't know why people want to go there and recommend the place to others. Comparing to Mango Tree, Shanmugas in Wellawatte could be in a lower price range, but we hardly get disappointing there. Because of our previous experience with Shanmugas we finally took the cousin there.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    My husband and I I have ordered from the Mango Tree on a number of occasions both online and on the phone. However, last night the service was appalling. We waited 3 hours for our food to be delivered from the time of ordering. I spoke to the driver, the online delivery service and the restaurant and and none seemed to know what on earth was going on. Initially they did not even bother to offer a refund or free meal as compensation. It is only when I mentioned that we worked at a highly prestigious school in the city did they ring and offer a refund. They have promised we will receive this today, we shall see…… We were highly disappointed by the whole experience and will be very reluctant to recommend The Mango Tree to expats and locals alike in Colombo!\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Overall the food was really good but the manager was disrespectful and didn't make the customers feel welcome.", '\nIt is a shame that a good restaurant has to suffer to because of the inconsiderate nature of their manager who disrupts the peaceful ambiance.

So when my Japanese friends visited decided to let them have some authentic food, so went to Mango tree. The food was awfully greasy, sweet, salty and cold. The service was horrendous. 3 people, the bill was around 11,000 rupees. And I said I had not brought my priv. Card and for them to trace it with my details. Immediately came such rude answer from the counter guys. That discount of 10% is no big deal but the way they were talking in a rude manner just made me annoy them more. Never mind that, the worst was on our way back to the hotel, my friend threw up at the galle face. That much for their food and service. I have the bill, photos everything, and can easily report to the authorities.

We were told that the outside seating area was closed so we had to sit inside . The sofas and chairs inside were so awkwardly placed . The tables were too close to each other it had the ambiance of a third rated food joint. You would obviously like some personal space from whoever sitting at the adjoining table.

We ordered a mutton dish which came with 6 small-medium sized chunks. for Rs 1500! the "aloo" parata and the lentils curry was okay-ish but not "so good".  Definitely not worth the price paid.
