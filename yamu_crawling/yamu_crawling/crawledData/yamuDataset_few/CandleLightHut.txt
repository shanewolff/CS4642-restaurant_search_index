name: Candle Light Hut
excerpt: Candle Light Hut is a pretty popular, affordable place for Pakistani biriyani, paratha and meat curries. 
yamu_review: ["Candle Light Hut is an affordable family restaurant that serves up some great plates of Pakistani meats and biriyani. If you're out with a group and want to stuff yourself with South Asian spicy cuisine without ruining your wallet, this is not a bad choice.", "This is a pretty good place to consider if you're into Indian or Pakistani food (though they technically also have Italian and Western on the menu). The portions are big, so the prices are easy, and the curries are spicily prepared and delicious.\xa0"]

user_comments: ["\n\n                                    Thank you YAMU on that wonderful review on our restaurant. much gratitude for the service. Splendid explanation which shows more detail on the food type . and yes Pakistani foods are more of prepared more of Authentic spices and oil . few of the wide range of dishes in the menu are spicy . if you do have a tempt of having tender chicken or some mouth craving curry's,Soften  buriyani its just one stop and all the countries under one roof :D  to be more specified one hut ;) …", '\nfor further information Candle light  do also serve Pakistani,Chinese,Italian, Western', '\nAny issues or related comments Customers are requested to feel free and come up to the management for their opinion and suggestion to help us serve you better.', '\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    It'd be great if you all can publish their menu with the price tags. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    It was 8pm Friday night where we were informed that Chicken Biriyani was unavailable. This was an inauspicious start but the Kadai Chicken certainly made up for it.', "\nOverall, it was pleasant experience where the bill didn't give you indigestion. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Kumar thank you for that wonderful comment . and its sad to hear that you didn't get the dish . unfortunately on Friday its kind of the buriyani fiesta :P first come fist serve basis and to meet to heavy demand its  a bit challenging .  but i would recommend you to make reservations through the hotline so that its been prepared to our requirements. however we would also suggest a 30 min heads up  so the quality standards remain the same ^_^ cheers \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    We bought Chicken kadai after the review we seen so far, but didnt like the way it was prepared. It didnt have salt and any aroma that we were expecting to have in a pakistani dish or any indian dish. The chicken was cooked with the skin and we felt as it was not cleanly prepared.  Bad Experience so far. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    we hearty apologize for the issue you have faced at the restaurant about the "chicken khadai"  unfortunately sir we do serve khadai with skin and without under our dish range from the customers request . we have faced . if would rather be the issue that our stewards wouldn\'t have elaborated the customer preferences & choices. we would love you to drop by next time and check in with your requirements hopefully . again the management  would co-operate with any needs the consumers prefer thank you ^_^ \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    i have been to this place 3 times and i find it quite charming. they got everything in order. the service , food and beverages, ambiance, etc. once the order was bit late i think that's coz i went during the ramazan fest. prices are quite reasonable and  i think they got some good potential so my only hope is that they will maintain the quality and be consistent in future as i have seen many restaurants looses the zest after a while…keep the candle burning!!!!!\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I only had bad experience at candle light hut. The service is horrible and so is food. The extra special butter naan is like burned cheese cake and the beef kuruma was overcooked. I was so disappointed because I was expecting some delicious food on my plate. But I had to leave the place with bad stomach and angry face. Not only the food, they do not have any fruit drinks that mentioned in the menu. We ended up buying soft drinks. This place need to come up with good service and good food. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Firstly this place is very nice and stuff!! I don't want to be a spoil sport, but these guys need to improve ALOT when it comes to service, customer service is basically nil. I have waited for more than 45mins to 1 hours till my food comes when I dropped in for dining once! Their food sadly doesn't taste the same everytime (I still go there Coz it's the nearest restaurant for me and is a fair value for money) I mean I'm not crying about everything, but you guys need to improve the service and few other parts. Sometimes it's stinky inside, sticky tables, and grumpy uneducated guy on the cashier. He never wears a smile on his face! I just called to place and order and he took my main dish order and just hung up on me before I could order any drinks. That's sad!", "\nOwner please look more into this business, you can do a better job! Try to make people wait less also. I just wanted to let u know this so you can improve. Overall I'd give this place a 6/10 ! Good luck .\n                                            "]
