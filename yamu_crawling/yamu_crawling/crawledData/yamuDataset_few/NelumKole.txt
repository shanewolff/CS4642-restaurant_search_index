yamu_review: ['Where can you be sure to find pork curry for lunch? A good Sinhalese rice-and-curry ', ', of course. That is exactly what Nelum Kole does. If you live or work around Maharagama/Boralesgamuwa, this spot off Lake Road is one you need\xa0to try out. It ought to go without saying, but I‚Äôll reiterate,\xa0their food is not halal, and they do not serve beef.', 'Ideal for takeaway, Nelum Kole serves up pork, chicken and fish options, along with an array of greens and vegetables. For a little over Rs. 200,\xa0you can grab a full or half plate of\xa0red or white rice, with a meat of your choice, and choose what else goes on your plate as the server runs through the options with you.', 'They‚Äôre really busy during lunchtime, so be prepared to stand in line. If you‚Äôre eating in, the food is served on a lotus leaf (hence the name), and offered to you in a woven basket. As you pay for your meal, notice that the cashier will touch the inside of his right elbow with his left hand. This is a gesture that is best returned as you hand over the cash.\xa0', 'I had the pork curry with red rice, ', ', manioc curry, ', ' and beans. I was then asked if I would like any additional meat that included\xa0two types of fried fish, fried chicken neck and batter-fried prawns. I was curious to try the prawns, so I did, at an additional\xa0cost of Rs. 240.', "The food here is salty by my standards, so if you're\xa0watching your blood pressure, drink plenty of water. The ", " was neither hard nor too mushy, and a lively shade of yellow. The manioc curry was my favourite as the salt hadn‚Äôt saturated it, so it helped balance out the rest of the meal. The beans were nothing to write home about ‚Äî\xa0they were green, they were curried, and they were beans. And I didn‚Äôt get my money‚Äôs worth on the prawns. Although they weren't aggressively seasoned, they had been chilling outside on the\xa0display for a while and had lost their crispness. If you‚Äôre going to go for any of the fried options, go early! Like at 12 noon.\xa0", 'Now that we‚Äôve got all that out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about the pork. You have the options of grilled pork, curry pork and devilled pork to go with your rice. The curry pork I had was a generous portion, but\xa0when closely analysed, it turned out to be 60% fat and 40% meat. The meat itself was flavourful, but by no means could you call it a good cut. If you‚Äôre into the juicy, fatty bits, then you‚Äôre going to love it. Next time, I‚Äôll be trying the\xa0grilled pork.', 'When you‚Äôre done eating, you can leave your lotus leaf and basket on the table, wash your hands and head out, while the\xa0servers swiftly ready the tables for the next lot of customers.\xa0', 'This is where Nelum Kole really scores. Though it looks rather unassuming from the outside, you notice the rustic decor and thatched roof\xa0the moment you step in.\xa0It has the authentic Sinhalese ', ' feels, and warm yellow lighting that really brings out the earthy walls.\xa0', 'The tables and chairs are the furthest thing from fancy, and that‚Äôs part of the charm. It‚Äôs rustic. It‚Äôs warm. It‚Äôs welcoming. And, if you ask nicely, you can join a table where there are already others sitting down to a meal.\xa0\xa0', 'Nelum Kole is not necessarily a place you‚Äôd take your better half to on a date. But it‚Äôs a convenient and cost-effective option for lunch if you work or happen to be driving through the area.\xa0', 'Their regulars claim it is the best option in the vicinity and find no fault in the food. I think it‚Äôs too salty, and I would have liked more meat in my pork curry. The positives?\xa0They do a great job of dealing with a high volume of take-away orders, and I didn‚Äôt find myself wasting time standing in line. Besides, two people can eat here for Rs. 500. Need I say more?', '\xa0']
