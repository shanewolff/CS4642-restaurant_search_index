excerpt: Sits has been our favourite cake baker for a while. Her chocolate and red velvet cupcakes are some of the best in town. 
yamu_review: ['Sita has been making cakes for almost a decade, and her stuff is consistently great.\xa0', 'occasion', "Sits has a long range of cakes and cupcakes, and there's an overwhelming number of options for lovers of chocolate. There's also a bit of cheesecake, meringue, coffee, lemon and passion fruit on the menu - also chocolate cookies and brownies. She also does eclairs, but the minimum order for those is 20.", "We asked for the red velvet cupcakes and the chocolate ganache cupcakes, 5 cupcakes for about Rs. 700 altogether. Sits cupcakes are always very soft and they don't change over time - we had one the next day and it was still as soft and happiness inducing. The chocolate ganache cupcake is soft, chocolatey and good and for some reason tasted even better 24 hours later (in our experience cakes tend to get drier and the frosting hardens over time). It was the red velvet that we absolutely loved though: a bite of it includes this incredibly creamy and generous cream cheese topping, delightfully blending in with soft fluffy cake, the kind of dessert you'll keep going at till you feel unwell.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Sits has been our favourite cake baker for a while - she makes some of the best chocolate and red velvet cupcakes in town. \n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Sits Cakes and Desserts is one of the classics, and it's our favourite by far.
