name: Cafe Beverly 
excerpt: Cafe Beverly is a comfortable, affordable dining space in the premises of the Beverly Street shopping complex in Rajagiriya. 
yamu_review: ["Cafe Beverly is a very cosy dining space inside the Beverly Street shopping complex in Rajagiriya. If you're in that part of town, it's not a bad place to chill out and grab a meal - the food is well done, the milkshakes are great, and it's not too costly.\xa0", "The menu here is a wide assortment of randoms - you get burgers and sandwiches, then some Thai and some Indian too. As the name suggests, there's a cafe vibe to the place, doesn't feel like serious dining. Not expecting much, we randomly asked for a plate of cuttlefish in tamarind sauce.", "These guys get points for presentation with every plate. The cuttlefish arrived in a little bowl and right on the bat it looked and smelled very appetizing. There were about ten pieces in the dish, for Rs. 570, and they came curled up in fried onion, golden-brown crisp and smothered in that lovely sweet tang of tamarind - we whacked it all in one go. Really good stuff, would recommend you get the cuttlefish here if you're visiting.\xa0", "Then our bistro seafood burger arrived. Again, very cute presentation for a shopping complex cafe - love the fries on this one, very crispy and tossed in a bit of chilli. The burger wasn't astonishing or anything, the bread and the fillings were dry and separate (as opposed to good, moist compositions like the ones at Rocket Burger and Streat360), but still, the meat was tasty and fine and it's not a bad choice for a quick snack. For Rs. 560, this is a pretty filling meal.\xa0", 'We also got some classic fish and chips, for Rs. 570. The fillet was wonderfully soft and well seasoned with a very thin crisp skin, went well with the coleslaw and mayo. These guys take special care of their meat servings.\xa0', "There's also a wide range of drinks available, cocktails, shakes, et al. Very few cafes do drinks that stand out, but our Tropical Cooler was really well put together. It cost just Rs. 200 and is a thick shake of mango, passion fruit and strawberry ice cream. It was milky with all the flavours coming out strong, especially the creaminess of the ice cream and the passion fruit. This is a good place to kick back and just have a drink in the middle of a hot day.\xa0", "Right smack in the middle of the crazy traffic in Kotte between KFC and Keells is the big Beverly Street shopping complex. It's a hot and bustling space, but as soon as you walk up the stairs and into the cafe, you're suddenly cocooned inside A/C, clean cane and green all around. It's a pleasant and quiet place and I can imagine going back with friends for some cuttlefish and milkshakes. ", "Service was good during our visit, with the manager himself attentive to customers, and dishes arriving in a few minutes from the kitchen, whose chefs you can watch through an open counter. Also on a side note, they've got clean, nice bathrooms here, which is always a plus point at busy diners.\xa0", "Cafe Beverly is good at what they do. The food wasn't mind blowing, but the stuff we ordered from their wide range was tasty and made us happy. The mains here are for around Rs. 550 and the drinks at around Rs. 200, and considering the care put into the food and the portions, we wouldn't complain about it. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a good place for a quiet meal.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Cafe Beverly is the comfy, cosy dining space inside the Beverly Street shopping complex in Rajagiriya. \n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    කැෆේ බෙවර්ලි එකේ සර්විස් එකත් ගොඩක් හොඳයි. කෑම බීම ටික පටපට ගාලා මේසෙට එනවා. \n                                                                                                                            ']

So I hailed down a waiter and asked for a food menu and he says no menu cards available and went to fetch one from another table! It was too much for me and I left without waiting fr the drinks which never arrived in 20mins and asked th manager to close shop if they can't run a proper service.

Rather annoyed coz there were only 6 tables of people we hailed down a waiter. When inquired he mentioned they only had a couple of menus to go around! Geez…what was the management expecting when they launched this place? We will try again once they pritn more menu cards….LOL', '\nThe place itself has great potential with good seating, nice chilled out location, plenty of space and possibly good drinks and food which we could not order this time. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Not sure why my comment submitted twice didnt get published!', '\nVisited this place on a evening where about 6 tables had diners.

Was not sure what to expect, having read the main review and following comments. But I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered (they do have printed menus now) a papaya salad which tasted amazing and was well presented. Excellent potion size and good value for money. I also ordered a Tom Yum soup to go. I was a  bit skeptical as most places don't get the flavours right. The soup tasted brilliant. Spicy but not overbearing with a very generous amount of seafood in the soup. Very polite and efficient service. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I went there many times and had very good experiences. Must say their juices and food prices match the quality and the service. No place ever gives complimentary naan with the curry, their mutton buriyani is perfectly cooked with a good amount of spices. Desserts isn't much to die for but if anyone wants to have a good meal which matches the price Beverly cafe is what I recommend. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Tasty food for a very reasonable price.', '\nCalm, whelmed Location.', "\nBut most of all, Best service I've had by a well trained, friendly staff.", '\nEnjoyed dinner & looking forward to visit soon… \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Nice place with good food for reasonable price. We ordered southern fried chicken, Thai chicken and prawns noodles and juice and a shake. Chicken is so tender and tasty, properly fried and served with vegetables and wedges. And Noodles was good too. Average portions size but it was sufficient all together with shakes/drinks thought we were so hungry. Milkshakes are one of the best you can get for that price. And wide variety of beverages/juice/shakes/tea/coffee are available on the menu. Has a huge dessert with few layers of Ice cream, fruits, and cream. Prices are very much reasonable. Everything cost us around 2000 for 2 people. And most importantly service was up to good standards. Friendly and warm, well trained staff.

The food never fails to impress along with the plating, drinks are wonderful with great value for money. Service is good on most days and it shows that they are trying to keep a high standard every time. If this was located elsewhere in Colombo would have become more popular instead being tucked away beside a shopping complex. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Cafe was excellent with superb food and the service before new year 2016.

Very poor……thumbs down for that…\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    After new year 2016….this is shit….guys don't chase for money…keep the good food and good service like before….\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I visited this place with my wife along with another couple.

I must say there were like 10 large pieces of fish left. (Okay… may be not 10…, but definitely not 2 either…) What we found out when we opened the left over food pack the next day was shocking. They have wrapped the rice and only 2 pieces of fish together.

When we told him we wanted to change he said that once he inputs the order with "the tab" a "guy" opens the beverage bottles…. Hence we couldn\'t order what we wanted.
