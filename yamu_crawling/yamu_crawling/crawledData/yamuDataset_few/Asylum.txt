excerpt: Three years after opening Asylum has upped its food and service game
yamu_review: ["It's been more than\xa0three years since Asylum opened, and at the time we rated it as rather mediocre. Since then we've\xa0heard great things about the food, and so went in to see if the fare had improved.\xa0", 'TL;DR: the food has\xa0vastly improved.\xa0', 'The Mediterranean Chicken Salad (Rs. 800) came first.', 'The chicken was interestingly prepared, in two big pieces instead of being cut up into little ones. it was definitely juicier as a result, which we really liked. The salad leaves were fresh and sun-dried tomatoes are always a nice touch.', 'Next up, the Barramundi (Rs. 1900) was dee-vine. The jalapeño sauce gave it a subtle, tangy dose\xa0of spice.\xa0The tahini and chick peas added\xa0texture to the soft fish.\xa0The color scheme in the presentation made me want to go nuts on my Instagram feed with it, but I\xa0resisted.', "I looved the Chimichuri Lamb Ribs (Rs. 3100), but yes it was also a tad on the fatty side. I love fatty lamb though, maybe you don't. It came with risotto, which was\xa0good too.\xa0Not too creamy.\xa0Clever move,\xa0holding back on the grease, this is all too often not the case. The vegetables were not too soft, not too hard.\xa0Perfect texture.", "The Coconut Lime Cheesecake (Rs. 900) was, and perhaps you're sensing a theme here, really good. The mango sauce perfectly complemented\xa0the bite of the lime, and the coconut rode in as aftertaste. The only disappointing thing was the strawberry. This dish didn’t need more sour, some sweet berries would have been much better.", 'The ambience doesn’t excite you, but it has a subdued charm, really private and secluded. And the AC is on maxxa chill, making it cold inside on a hot Colombo day. We almost found ourselves wishing for sweaters.\xa0', "Not bad but could be better. We weren't offered any water, and our plates were taken away before we could completely finish licking the barramundi off them. I mean who does that?", "We tried a\xa0perfectly chilled\xa0Prosecco (Rs. 1050), which was honestly the best Prosecco I've ever had.\xa0The color reminded me of\xa0the sunset\xa0that time I\xa0was\xa0driving my Alfa Romeo Spider in the North of Italy. Besides that\xa0we didn't try any of the drinks. But ", '\xa0last time, and from what we can gather they are still quite good.', "Asylum has seriously upped its food game, though some service quirks still need to be fixed. Definitely look to spend around 7k for two people, more if you're having drinks.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    We went back after three years to find out if Asylum has upped its food game.

I have seen enough such people in other places such as Kaema sutra and have no problem with them at all. What I wanted to know is whether this is a dedicated bar than a restaurant where it is more likely occupied by regular & heavy drinkers (who have higher tendancy for aggressive behaviour) than people who you are referring to. I have some bad experiences with such places before.

We were shown 3 menues but when we started ordering from the courtyard menue we were specifically told that the food from that menu will only be served after 6pm AND ONLY IN THE COURTYARD. NOT INSIDE!!! We even had the Chef, Samath (sic?) coming out to tell us this. We specially wanted the 3 sliders from the courtyard menu, which they of coursed refused to serve us. We then ordered some items from the snack menu. We then proceeded to sit at a table inside. Just seated next to our table was an English couple (I spoke to them as we also came from the UK). As we were waiting, around 5.40pm the English couple were served the 3 sliders dish from the Courtyard menu. I was astonished as we were very specifically told that we couldn't have it before 6pm and also inside. I actually asked the English couple which menu they ordered from. And they told me it was from the COURTYARD MENU!!! of course by which time, All of us were angry and annoyed why the rules were only for some people while others have no problem. We walked out without wanting to eat anything from there. It is so disappointing that the service at this eatery depends on the colour of your skin. oday 20th Jult 2015, we (4 adult and one child) got to this so called popular eatery around 5pm.

But lately I have been made a fool of, where they don't explain terms and conditions clearly to their customers. The prices were much reasonable and worth every penny as they started,  but under the new management I feel they try to squeeze every penny off their clientele as they're now poorly patronised.
