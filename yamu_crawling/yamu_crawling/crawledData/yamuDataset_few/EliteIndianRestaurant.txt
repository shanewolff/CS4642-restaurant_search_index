yamu_review: ["Elite is an Indian restaurant offering savory\xa0veg and non-veg Indian dishes, as well as\xa0Indian sweets. It's been around for a while and some would consider it an establishment. We dropped in for lunch and were quite disappointed with the fare.\xa0", "From rice to naan to noodles, Elite has quite a lot to offer on their extensive menu. We started off with a Chicken 65 (Rs 360). Deliciously red and crisp, we got 8 pieces that weren't too dry but weren't too flavourful either.\xa0", "We went the naan route, trying out the Paneer Naan (Rs 100), Butter Naan (Rs 80), Garlic Naan (Rs 90) and the Kheema Naan (Rs 240). The butter naan and garlic naan were the usual fare, nothing to remark on there. The paneer naan was quite disappointing. There was just a smattering of paneer that didn't lend much to the texture or taste of the naan. The kheema naan was pretty good, though, with lots of meat and onion wrapped up inside soft naan. It's pretty oily, especially when you get to the bottom end, but it's also quite delicious.\xa0", "The Elite Special Mutton (Rs 550) was a travesty. I don't understand why they would put their name on this dish, let alone call it special, when there is hardly any meat in it. All we got was jagged bones with a bit of fat on them. What was described as a kheema gravy was actually just an eggy curry. Do not order this, ever.\xa0", 'To wash down our sadness, we ordered a Strawberry Lassi (Rs 180) and a Sweet Lassi (Rs 140). The strawberry lassi was disappointing. It tasted like the synthetic Kotmale strawberry milk, lacking the tartness you expect from a lassi, which was disappointing since it would work with the natural taste of strawberry. The sweet lassi was legit, though, with a definite taste of curd, with reassuring sour notes, not too sweet and not too thick.', "The ultimate disappointment, though, was the Baked Alaska (Rs 350). Yes, we know, it's not an Indian dessert, but it was on the menu so we tried it anyway. First off, the cake is so dry. The ice cream tastes super cheap and synthetic. The presentation is godawful.\xa0It just doesn't make for a good finish to what was already an underwhelming meal.", "The place itself is pretty gaudy. They've got blue lighting off the ceiling, for some odd reason, and the furnishing is quite tacky. Service-wise, the waiters kind of waft about and aren't very attentive. The food can sometimes take forever\xa0too.", "Elite gets a lot of business, particularly takeaway orders, and it's definitely got a clear customer base. We wouldn't count ourselves among them, though, because the fare is pretty mediocre. At their price point, though, you won't get Indian food that's much better. If you're willing to dish out a little more, you'd get a better bang for your buck at ", '.

Elite has taken a dramatic change in terms of ambiance. It used to be this mid size hot spot for "Saiwarr" food and ambiance but now it has gotten a face lift with an air conditioned restaurant. Since we (2 persons) were not sure what to order, we went with 2 Tandoori naans and a quarter fried chicken. Boy! weren\'t we disappointed. There wasn\'t enough food for 2. We then ordered a Nasi Goreng and I must confess that it\'s the best modernized Nasi Goreng that you will find anywhere in Colombo. Served in a square bowl with ample vegies+flavor. They also sprinkle it with chicken + sea food (mainly small prawns). The portion is good enough for (figure conscious) 2 persons. Yes, Nasi Goreng has a lot of rice. My recommendation is that stick to the traditional "saiwarr" type food at elite and do not opt for for "executive" type food. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I agree. They take a long time to serve food. But I can say one thing. You can't get a better a biriyani for that price anywhere else in Colombo. Even Raheema (which is close by and has the saivar kade atmosphere) has a price tag of Rs.320 for their chicken biriyani and it is nowhere as tasty and the portion is not enough for a foodie like me. I think the problem with Elite is their extensive menu. They can't handle the orders they get because there are so many different items. But if you are not in a rush, under a budget and want to fill your self with tasty food, Elite is an ideal place.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    is very good indian food ', '\r\n', '\r\nbr', '\r\ngsmfather.com\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Very disappointing experience. We went there on the 1st of November. Went there at around 9.30 and it took at least 20 to 30 mins to get the food. At around 10:30 we wanted to order more and the waiter said that this will be the last order for the day and said we cant order after that.They said that their kitchen was closing. So since we came in a crowd we ensured that we ordered the right quantities again. When we were about to leave we saw the same waiter taking another order of a customer who had just walked in. We confronted the waiter and asked him for an explanation and he explained that it was the Chinese restaurant that was closing and not the Indian. So just think for yourselves, when a customer walks in to a restaurant do you ask whether he is going to have Indian or Chinese? They dont have the menus separated either.

We asked for the manager and sent the dishes back. He said he would have it remade, and promised there would be no more seafood. He then suggests the mixed rice, instead of the nasi goreng, and we agreed. The mixed rice comes out and just as we were about to eat, lo and behold, we find more prawns in it.

The mutton biriyani came with a generously tiny piece of bone while the chicken in the chicken biriyani felt positively undercooked.  It also seemed like the chefs had been told that they needed to clear all the salt in the kitchen because almost all of it was found in the dishes that we ordered.

He took my receipt and disappeared to the kitchen.", '\nAnother few minutes went and my wife went to the car as she could not take it anymore. Finally the food came and the man who was holding it was having a nice conversation with another person without giving us the food. I was like WTF??? I asked the front desk man again and he took the food from the guy and gave me. I was really damn annoyed.', '\nAfter taking the food I complained to them saying it was bad customer service. And I told them if they are taking 1 hour for such small items, they must be taking 5 to 6 hours for a buriyani or a sawan. I was stunned to hear his excuse which went as follows.', '\n" SIR THE ORDER HAS NOT GONE FROM THE COMPUTER TO THE KITCHEN THAT WAS THE DELAY" I WAS LIKE WTF?????', '\nI told him you should have gone and checked since we were sitting there waiting for the food and wasting our time. The man was not ready to accept his fault . and his next response was outrageous.', '\n"IF YOU DON\'T LIKE THE SERVICE AND PLACE, DON\'T COME AGAIN. WE ARE OK WITH IT. ( his response in Sinhalese "Awe nathi wunata Awulak NA !! ) "" This really ticked me off…', "\nI was like WTF??? IS THIS HOW THEY TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS?? IS THIS CORRECT CUSTOMER SERVICE?? I felt like throwing the food at the man's face but didn't since my wife was hungry . I came out from the place NEVER WILL I GO TO SUCH A DIRTY ROTTEN RESTAURANT where they don't know how to treat their customers.", '\nI NEVER ATE THE FOOD and EVEN MY DOG REFUSED TO EAT IT. Elite is such a bad restaurant and I am surprised that people still go there. Please THINK TWICE before you go there. The people in that place does not know HOW TO TREAT their customers.', '\nCheers !!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    WORST INDIAN RESTAURANT EVER!', '\n', '\nDirty place, nasty atmosphere, unpleasant area, rude manager, and many other terrible sides.', '\nNo body can speak English, as a tourist it was the worst place that I visit in Sri lanka.', "\nI ordered Mutton Beryani (an Indian food that I had several times), I can swear that it wasn't mutton buryani!  The cuisines taste was horrible, my rice was cool and I couldn't find even a small piece of mutton in mu curry. I asked the manager to change my dish with a warm rice and (absolutely) mutton curry instead of bone curry! he took my food and after 10 minutes bring the same dish for me.", '\nIf it was my first experience of eating Indian food, definitely I never try them again!', '\nI could have the best meal in Colombo with this price!\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Had the worst experience ever. The service is really bad! Specially the waiters… So rude and they don't pay much attention to customers at all. Very disappointed!

I left right afterwards. Informed the people at the counter downstairs. I think one of them were the owners, didnt even bother to care. Just said ok no need to pay your bill. This sort of place needs to be shut down!!!! No point writing bad reviews. For once some action needs to be taken. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    The most unhygienic restaurant I have been too and the food is no better.
