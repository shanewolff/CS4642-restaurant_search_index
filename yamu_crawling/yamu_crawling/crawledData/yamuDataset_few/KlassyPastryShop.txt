I stored the cake in cool dry place on Saturday evening when we cut the cake and tasted it it was TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING SITUATION , THE CAKE WAS SPOILED, WITH A BAD BUTTER OR OIL TASTE COMING FROM THE CAKE. ALSO THE ICING WAS GIVING TOTALLY SOUR , BITTER TASTE.

He said he can remember me calling him and he say i need the spoil cake to taste to see if its true. My bill average when i walk in to Kalssy Colombo is above LKR1000, he say you may be a customer who comes you should keep the spoil cake and bring it to me. who on earth will store a spoil cake.  This man ROSHAN is a very bad guy who does not know how to talk to customers HE IS THE MOST RUDE, ARROGANT , BIG-HEADED PERSON WHO IS NOT SUITABLE  TO BE A MANAGER . He say he checked with chef and OWNER of Klassy - I can’t imagine if the OWNER IS A SUCH STINGY PERSON. HE SAID OWNER REQUESTED TO SAY THIS HAPPENS EARLIER TOO WITH CUSTOMERS BUT WE CANT HELP IT, WE WILL NOT PROVIDE A COMPENSATION TREAT OR ANY APOLOGY TO ANY CUSTOMERS.   ROSHAN THE SO CALLED MANAGER NEVER EVEN SAID SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPEN EVEN, SAID I CANT HELP IT THESE THINGS HAPPEN EVEN THE OWNER SAID TO IGNORE CUSTOMER COMPLAINS.
