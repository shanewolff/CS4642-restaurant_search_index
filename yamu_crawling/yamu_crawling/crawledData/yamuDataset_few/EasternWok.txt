yamu_review: ['If your stomach is\xa0being indecisive and\xa0cannot decide what it needs, you might want to give Eastern Wok a go as they serve Chinese, Indian and Arabian food, although Chinese seems to be the more favored cuisine by the looks of their menu.', "In under 10 minutes, food was served. +1\xa0for the quick lunch! (However, it's not always this fast as I have patronized Eastern Wok before. So, I\xa0am assuming they are pretty quick during lunch hours because of the orders \xa0they receive\xa0for executive lunches.)\xa0", 'We opted for Chinese, saving our taste buds the muddle of a fusion of cuisines.\xa0We\xa0ordered\xa0a portion of Devilled Chicken (Rs 795), a portion of Wok Special Mixed Fried Rice (Rs 720) and a portion of the good, old, Sri Lankan Chinese classic, Deep Fried Cuttlefish in Hot Butter Sauce (Rs 885).', 'The Devilled Chicken was the standard\xa0spicy yet sweet\xa0chicken settled in with thick, glossy gravy.', "The dish didn't take me to Devilled Chicken Heaven, but it was pretty good. The flavours could have\xa0come through more strongly and someone needs to stop the chef from throwing in too many tomatoes, but otherwise it wasn't disappointing.\xa0", "The portion of cuttlefish was fairly large, but tastewise, I'd say 6.5/10 because it was a little too sweet and the batter was a little too lumpy. Not the best out there, but not the worst either.", 'The Wok Special Mixed Fried Rice, on the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, cats and dogs, was the true winner. The portion was magnificient, enough to feed 4-5 people, or 10\xa0earthlings\xa0on a diet. Very well spiced with generous amounts of shrimp and fried chicken tossed in, this was worth every cent.', '\xa0', 'The interior has a Middle Eastern touch and there is plenty of comfortable seating, including upstairs seating.\xa0', "In terms of service, the staff seem to be adequately trained. They weren't overly friendly and knew what they were doing. In fact,\xa0the rice was ordered upon their recommendation. On the whole,\xa0the service wasn't too amiable, but that's not a bad thing because being extra genial can be a little pesky.", 'In conclusion, the food is not the best in the city and there definitely is a lot of room for improvement in terms of really bringing out the piquancy of the cuisines, but their portion sizes mean the bucks are not gone to waste.', 'Not a disappointing experience and will definitely go back for the yummy rice!']

I ordered Steamed Rice, Hong Kong Chicken and a Prawn Foo Yung. The chicken was smothered in Sauce brimming with MSG and way too much Oyster Sauce and too spicy for my liking.', '\r\n', '\r\nThe deal breaker was my partners Chicken Biriyani and my Prawan Foo Yung. The chicken Biriyani had no flavouring and was served with a fried egg,NOT a boiled and Fried egg but a Bullseye like for Nasi Goreng and a little portion of the amount paid ', '\r\n', '\r\nThe Prawn Foo Yung had a Chemical taste and blue prawns in itâ€¦i was absolutely shocked at this and reported to the manager who took it back in but denied any of my comments, i did not have an appetite to eat any more, and denied any new dish which was offered by the manager.', '\r\n', '\r\nDisappointing to have had this experience.', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Last Thursday , I went to Eastern wok for dinner with my family. As I can recall last time ( 2 years back) when I visit this place, this crowded and need to wait for a table. ', '\r\n', '\r\nThose days, I frequently visit this place and I love their food and portion. But today it was weird there is no one on a Thursday at 7:30pm. I figured it out why there is no one expect us, once this incident occurred to me.', '\r\n', "\r\nWe ordered noodles for me and wife and club sandwich for my 5 year old child. My kid didn't like it much and he was eating French fries for a while. Then my wife tried to feed the sandwich to him. ", '\r\n', '\r\nAt that time my wife figured out there is a worm in the sandwich. Then she panicked shouted there is a worm. Quickly the waiter came and took the food. ', '\r\n', '\r\nTheir manager came and said they removed the club sandwich from the bill and apologized. This is not what they should do and what we expect in these places. They should be more careful when they preparing their meal. Specially for a small kid. ', '\r\n', "\r\nThank god that my kid didn't eat the club sandwich. But he had fever and loose motion for 2 days. Doctor said this might be a food poison. He is fine now.", '\r\n', '\r\nWhy we go to a good reputed place and pay more? Because we think these places serves hygiene food and good customer service more than anything. Eastern wok is a horrible place and I will never visit this place.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I visited this Tuesday with my family for Dinner.  It was wired that the place was empty and we were the only family there at that time. Also, When we looked at their Menu list with Prices, We got a shock to see their prices are far to expensive that any other Hotel buffets.  In fact we were to leave the place, immediately after seeing the price of their food, but decided to stay on for Dinner.  When we inquired from them as to how many pax can share a portion,  we were told that 1 portion would enough for 3 pax. But we were shocked to see the dishes they served us.  We ordered 1 Portion of Beef Black Pepper (it was only 3 pieces were there) and Sizzling Chicken with Black Pepper (the dish was watery and no taste what so ever) and the Butter Naan ( was served with Pita bread).  We have been to so many places for dinner but never came across a place like this before.  Almass Restaurant is far better than this.  Even Cinnamon Grand buffet is cheaper than this.  I will never recommend this place.', '\n \n                                            ']
