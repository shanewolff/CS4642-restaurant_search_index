name: Tang Dynasty
excerpt: Tang Dynasty  is one of the most authentic ones we've been to, the interior is amazing and the food is top notch. 
yamu_review: ["Tang Dynasty is one of the newer Chinese restaurants in town that serves up authentic Chinese cuisine. You've probably passed by their premises without ever noticing, as they've got a pretty humble location on Dickman's Road. Their menu is quite extensive, covering the cuisines of quite a few regions with a good deal of dishes that suit the Sri Lankan palate, though they aren't by any means Sri Lankanized. We dropped in for dinner and had the smoothest dining experience.", "The interior at Tang is quite a treat to the eyes as it's well lit and ornamented tastefully. There's nothing over the top about the decor, which we appreciate because some Chinese restaurants really go too far (see ", '). This would be a great spot for a date night, or if you just want to indulge someone on their birthday or any other special occasion.', 'When they started up, their staff was mostly Chinese, but now they have well-trained Sri Lankan staff that know the menu well. They are prompt and polite, hovering just out of sight to make sure you have everything you need.\xa0', "With their menu being as large as it is, ordering can be a bit daunting if you're not too familiar with Chinese cuisine. Don't hesitate to ask your waiter,\xa0as he\xa0will be more than happy to make recommendations. While a lot of the dishes are priced above Rs 2888, if you look carefully, you'll find a few gems priced under Rs 1000.", 'We ordered small portions of the Dried Fried Rice Noodles with Beef (Rs 568), Griddle Pork with Black Fungus (Rs 688), and the Kung Pao Shrimp (Rs 768) on the recommendation of the waiter. The food arrived in what felt like 10 minutes. They brought out all the dishes at once, including the pork and black fungus that came with a live cooking station. The food looked great and smelled amazing, so it was quite difficult not to dig in before taking photographs.', "Let's start with the noodles. I love noodles. These are easily up there amongst my favourite noodle dishes. There was plenty for two, and the noodles were very flavourful with a meatier soy sauce going on. I'm usually not a fan of beef dishes, but the beef in this dish was plentiful, tender and\xa0juicy. This alone would have made for a satisfying meal and we hadn't even gotten to the side dishes yet.", "Still cooking at our table, the pork and black fungus was a pretty sight to behold. If you've never experienced this, it's a ", 'magic effect. The cilantro worked as a contrast, visually, as well as a bright kick, taste-wise. Melting in your mouth, the fatty bits of pork go really well with the black fungus. At times, black fungus can be too firm and crunchy, almost like cartilage. Instead, this was a succulent treat.\xa0', "Finally, we went at the shrimp, and, man, were they good. The sauce on this really rounded out the whole experience, both when enjoying the shrimp on its own as well as when mixed in with the other dishes. It has a strong spiciness with a mild sweet and sour running right through. The shrimp were cooked just right, so they weren't a rubbery disaster, thankfully. I don't even like peanuts but I appreciated how they worked in the context of this dish. Definitely\xa0would order this again. Actually, I'd probably go for this exact combo!", "This was the smoothest dining experience I've had in Colombo in a long time, and I'm just going to have to give Tang Dynasty five stars for their service and fare. The food is authentic, the interior is tasteful and the service is polite and prompt. Though a lot of their dishes are priced rather steep, based on the execution of the dishes we ordered, we think they are probably worth it. If you order wisely, you can easily feast for two for Rs 2,700, after tax and service charge.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The food is authentic, the interior is tasteful and the service is polite and prompt. \n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Tang Dynasty is a new Chinese restaurant that's sprung up on Dickman's Road (now Dr Lester James Pieiris Mawatha) - it's one of the most authentic ones we've been to, the interior is amazing and the food is top notch. \n                                                                                                                            "]

When we walked in there were waiters scurrying everywhere and no one paid us attention, not even the casually dressed manager sitting at the reception playing on his phone. The waiters promptly brought us menus, but were not interested in helping us choose and stood there answering our questions in mono-syllables even when we spoke to them in Sinhala.  We had ordered lime juice without sugar, and they messed up this simple order twice. Once they brought the lime juice made with Sprite. Then they brought it with sugar, and on the third go they brought us the right one. The waiter was unapologetic and looked annoyed each time we politely told him. When the food was being laid out, another waiter knocked a cup of green and spilled it all over one of the guests. Again, no apology. Only a glum expression. We had to ask for plates once the food was brought!  Although we had been polite through the bad service in order not to spoil the dinner, the waiters did not smile or wish us goodbye when we left. They made us feel we should not have come. \n                                            "]
