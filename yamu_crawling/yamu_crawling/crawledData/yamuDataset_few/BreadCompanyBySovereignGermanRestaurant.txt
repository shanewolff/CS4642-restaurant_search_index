name: Bread Company By Sovereign German Restaurant
excerpt: At the Good Market, the Sovereign German Restaurant sells a range of loaves (sourdough, nutty, fiery mediterranean, etc). We don't really need to list them as you can try them all there. We've tried the sourdough and the mediterranean and they're quite good.
