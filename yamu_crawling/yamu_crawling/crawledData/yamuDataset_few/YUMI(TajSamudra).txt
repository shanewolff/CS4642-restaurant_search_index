yamu_review: ["YUMI is Taj Samudra's Japanese restaurant. What they lack in terms of variety they make up for with some delicious, specialized sushi in arguably the best setting for a Japanese restaurant in Colombo.", "In Colombo, YUMI definitely falls in the upper range of sushi restaurants, both in terms of quality and price. It's not as expensive as the likes of ", ' and ', ", but it's up there. In terms of range they cover most of the essentials - sushi, nigiri, teppanayaki and bento boxes. The only real flaw that we came across was the lack of pork on the menu, and that you can't get mixed nigiri. What we did order was excellent.", "The combination spicy maki (Rs. 1250 for 8) tasted downright fantastic. This is an inverted maki with salmon, tuna and crab meat served with a chili mayo sauce. Just the combination of the seafood in it should be enough to get anyone excited, and it also looks great with a little mosaic of sort forming in the center. What's great is that the flavour and texture of each come through beautifully and distinctly.", "The YUMI special maki (Rs. 1350 for 6) was another inverted maki, this time with tempura prawns and crab meat. The highlight of this was the 'rainbow rice'. It's called rainbow rice because of the addition of ", ', which is flying fish roe. This really elevates every element of the rice adding a bit of smokiness and crunch. Combined with the crab meat and tempura prawns, you have a great marriage of flavours.', 'Sushi aside, we also tried their tori teri bento (Rs. 1900) which is only available for lunch. This bento comes with steamed rice, a bit of pickled cabbage salad, teriyaki chicken and three pieces each of salmon and tuna sashimi as well as a miso soup.', "Just like the rest of the seafood we tried, the sashimi was very fresh and of high quality. The tuna they'd chosen was a cut with next to no fat, so it was this near translucent red which makes it that much more appetizing. The salmon on the other hand did have just a tad bit of fat which adds a slightly richer flavour.", 'The teriyaki chicken was also very tasty and cooked just right. The teriyaki sauce was the real winner here with a good consistency and balance of seasoning and sweetness.', 'The bento also comes with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Green tea ice cream generally tends to be mild, but this one had a very intense green tea flavour which was very refreshing and good way to end the meal.', "Unlike most Japanese restaurants in Colombo YUMI doesn't got for the pseudo traditional look, instead opting for a hip, modern set up with a black and orange theme, which works brilliantly. I'd go so far as to say that it's one of the best looking restaurants in Colombo. This is one place we can easily recommend for a business lunch.", 'The service during our visit was fast, friendly and very professional. We were the only ones there at the time but the waiters carried themselves very well and promptly handled little things like refilling the water and removing plates and such.', "YUMI hasn't quite reached the level of popularity it deserves. They do an excellent range of unconventional sushi with classy, modern ambience and great service.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    YUMI is Taj Samudra's resident Japanese restaurant.

Presentation of the maki rolls weren't too great either as the ends were left as they were and taste was not great either. In that sense I felt Nihonbashi was much better.

Fantastic place. Food was excellent. Plenty of excellent foreign beers to try out (Try the German rice beer, it's great).  Very good Japanese food.  Try the tuna nigiri (hand pressed sushi). Ask them to make 8 small potions, instead of the 4 big ones, since a normal nigiri portion is too big for our palette. The best is the Okonomiyaki (sort of a pizza like dish made with cabbage and seafood). Try the normal one withe seafood. It's excellent. Don't order the burgers. It's not that good. Only bad thing about this place is the music and also the TV. They only show Fashion TV. So, no IPL or football here.  Plus the music is bit too loud here. There is no dance floor here. It is not a pub for dancing. But they have a Aussie lady DJ playing dance music very loud. It's kind of difficult to talk here with the loud music. If they reduce the music and also show IPL, football ect, this could be even better place.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    No pork!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Wagyu beef & salmon steak  was delicious. …\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    all ingredients are very fresh and food is so tasty', '\r\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Yumi … Brings chicness and a modern edge to what is a boring and traditional venue … Music is modern and adds vibe thank you to the Australian dj Lady Renee for the great tunes not to loud at all !
