excerpt: Plunkett doesn't offer a significant improvement over roadside kottu, though the ambience and service are quite nice.
yamu_review: ["Posh is not something you normally associate with the word kottu, but it seems like a good idea. In our experience, however, Plunkett doesn't offer a significant improvement over roadside kottu, though the ambience and service are quite nice.", 'They have kottu, obviously. However, we were expecting a bigger variety than just 4-5 kottu dishes. Aside from that, they have also got a few starters and salad dishes.', 'We started off with a Posh Kottu Nasi Goreng (Rs. 880). First of all, there was nothing distinct in this dish that would make it stand out from the kottu that you get at normal street joints. In fact, it was quite underwhelming. The kottu was well cooked and seasoned, along with a generous amount of veggies mixed in, but the there was no nasi flavor which was disappointing. It was a decent dish but didn’t live up to the name and certainly not worth the price. It came with a delicious poached egg, which unfortunately was the highlight of the dish. I would have preferred it to be a little runnier though.', 'The Rosemary Infused Oven Roasted Chicken Kottu (Rs. 880) was bland. There was a generous amount of well-cooked roti tossed in\xa0with equal part veggies, but it was lightly seasoned. We asked for them to make it spicier but it was mildly so. The dish was filling, but\xa0not worth 800 bucks.\xa0There were a lot of chicken pieces, along with a poached egg which was the same as before.\xa0 \xa0\xa0', 'The curd (Rs. 350) was absolutely delicious. The thick texture of the curd and the sweetness of the treacle combined made up for a perfect dessert. We were pleasantly surprised to see how much the treacle crumbles elevated the dish and gave that tinge of extra sweetness.', 'The Mint and Lime Crush (Rs. 220) was alright. It was refreshing with a strong minty flavor but I feel like it could have been cooler.', 'Their service is excellent. There are about 3-4 people manning the place, and they were efficient, attentive and very friendly. While the food was not the best, it was one of the best services we have received.', 'The place was\xa0small with\xa0wooden chairs and tables, but not congested. The minimal wallart and the open kitchen gave us a slightly upscale version of the normal kottu joint vibe.', "Suffice to say we had high expectations which weren't quite met. The prices were way too exorbitant for the quality of the food, especially considering you can get the same kottu from a street joint, if not better.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Plunkett doesn't offer a significant improvement over roadside kottu, though the ambience and service are quite nice.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    කොහොමින් කොහොම හරි, කොත්තු සඳහාම වෙන් වුණු “පොෂ්” කඩයක් ගැන මීට මාසයකට වගේ කලින් අපට ආරංචියක් ආවා. \n                                                                                                                            ']
