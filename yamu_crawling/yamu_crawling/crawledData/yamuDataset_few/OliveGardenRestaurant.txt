We got the spicy peppered prawns with some seafood rice and chicken dumplings.", 'The prawns were very good (Rs. 890) - big, crunchy, a little salty, well flavoured and served with a generous toss of lettuce, onions and red chillies - a dish enough for two. This went great with the seafood rice which was light and not too oily and mixed with plenty of shrimp and cuttlefish.\xa0', 'The dumplings which you can get in any number, Rs. 30 each, are served with a side of watery chilli paste, but were a little underwhelming. They were small and filled with more vegetable than minced chicken.\xa0', "This is random but the orange juice we got here was one of the best we've had in ages, with a nice strong flavour. For Rs. 300 it comes in a very tall milkshake-ey glass.\xa0", "The interior in stereotypical affordable-Chinese-place fashion, features celebratory gold and white table decor where the chairs look like flowergirls at a wedding. It's clean and pleasant with sunlight streaming through the French windows at the back.\xa0", 'There are also a few private rooms upstairs if you feel like a private work or family party. Service was good when we were there, which it tends to be at newly opened restaurants - the Chinese manager herself stopped by to check on our dishes, and the waiters were friendly.\xa0', "Olive Garden is one of the good ones among Colombo's affordable and simple Chinese restaurants. It's in that genre of Chinese places that tries to cater a little to Sri Lankan tastebuds too without losing authenticity (Min Han is another one of these, though far better). It's only their first week in business, but so far so good.\xa0"]

user_comments: ['\n\n                                    Its another one of those restaurants where busloads of Chinese tourists are brought to eat their set menu meals on their tour packages. Fortunately they are dined and wined in a closed banquet hall. Therefore, there is no screaming and showing hare as at Xilaton. ', '\n', '\nBare basic lemon yellow, characterless, old fashioned décor. The waitstaff are alert, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. But don’t ask for their recommendations as they recommend mostly the deviled dishes which are far too spicy and far too oily – typical Sri Lankan Chinese fare.', '\n', '\nThey have the full range of seafood and meats cooked in several styles. Portions are smaller than at similar places. Prices on the menu are misleading. They bring the bill with a further 30% added on. That 30% includes a 10% called Service Charge which is meant to be distributed to the staff. However this Olive Garden restaurant pockets it and does not give it to the Staff. The Labour department and the hospitality rights lobbies should take this matter up and rectify it. Until such time we diners must question the owners when the bill arrives and refuse to pay this 10%.', '\n', '\nThe food comes quite fast. There is a set menu for lunch – It’s just 3 items Rice with a meat item and a vegetable. No soup or dessert . But it costs only Rs 500/- . An average small portion on the a-la-carte costs around Rs.1,000/- and is basically a personal portion too small for two to share. ', '\n', '\nThe only desserts are ice-cream and lychees. A few slices of watermelon and pineapple are served on the house whether or not you order dessert.', '\n', '\nOnly beer, and that too only canned Lion Larger is available but they do allow you to bring in your own bottles without any corkage. It’s a good place for a group of friends to meet up, spend a lot of time without being hurried and make a lot of noise.', '\n', "\nThere is parking for three to 4 vehicles in front. That’s sufficient during the day but at night it maybe a problem as parking isn't allowed on the surrounding roads\n                                            "]
