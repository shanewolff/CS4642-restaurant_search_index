With curry leaves and peanuts\xa0replacing the capsicum, and a deeper shade of yellow than the signature HBC bright yellow hue, their Hot Butter Cuttlefish tasted good, although a little more spice would have really made this super Sri Lankan.', 'For Rs 560, their regular portion, meant for two people, was enough for four or more. Loaded with shrimp and spring onions, this was mild in terms of spice and made for a satisfyingly massive portion of noodles.', 'Their Devilled Chicken was authentic Sri Lankan style devilled chicken. Doused in tomato sauce, this was spicy with a generous amount of chicken (about 8 pieces) and would make for a curry worth sharing among four people.', 'Babath in Hot Garlic Sauce, a Malay specialty, was satisfying, but a little too sweet for my liking. It was spicy, but mostly sweet.', "To oblivious creatures like myself, don't let the bustling counter at the entrance fool you. Malay Restaurant is more than just a food joint that does takeaways and deliveries.\xa0There is a well lit, spacious dining area suitable for families and large crowds.", 'Although the management did check up on us, the service was mediocre and slow.', 'With regard to health concerns, if we were to shut down food joints based on hygiene, Pettah, Aluthkade and the likes would have only a couple of restaurants to cater to gastronomical needs.\xa0', 'Based on our recent experience, Malay Restaurant is\xa0just as good as it was with tasty dishes and large portions, but\xa0there is a lot of potential for their\xa0waitstaff to\xa0get better in terms of friendliness and speed of service.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Serving good meals since 1994.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Malay Restaurant in Dehiwala is hugely popular, and after trying our their stuff we can see why.
