name: Baskin Robbins (Galle Road)
excerpt: From what we experienced, the Baskin Robbins on Galle Road is run-down and not a good value for money. They managed to disappoint us in pretty much every department, while charging us Rs. 1400 for a three scoop sundae and milkshake.

user_reviews: ["\n                                            Last month I visited their Kandy outlet located at KCC. it's really disappointing experience. Their cost way high and they don't really like us tasting before we buy. Even they don't have place to sit down and enjoy it.  it's really thumbs down for them.\n                                    ", '\n                                            YAMU    state "Go to Il Gelato. Their ice cream is WAY better and they actually cost less (yeah you know it\'s bad when Il Gelato costs less).". I have not tasted Baskin Robbins ice cream in Colombo. Guess it is dying a  slow death thanks to the attitude of the employees. I do enjoy the flovours put out by il gelato. As for il gelato employees I found those manning the counter at Cotton Collection very friendly and cheerful. The same cannot be said of those manning the outlet at Odel Alexandra place. At the time we walked in  the person we spoke to was not very helpful even suggesting  what flavour to try. She like the Baskin Robbins employee  you mentioned    just really didn\'t care. and looked depressed. May be her boy friend  just dumped her!!\n                                    ']

Hence the low quality tasting ice creams. Plus they don't even have 31 flavours -_-", '\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Check out the ice cream @ Sen Sal Outlets. 180/- per scoop. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Agreed, Sen Sal large restaurant ice cream range is heaps better.

Also the state of the outlets in Sri Lanka is terrible, don't know if there is a BR HQ that you can complain to as selling ice cream which taste worse than Alerix for Rs300 is robbery.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    @RR,', '\r\nI agree with you that the ice-cream is not creamy and the quality is not the same as abroad. It is not honest to reduce the quality and still charging the high price!! Will not visit.\n                                            ']
