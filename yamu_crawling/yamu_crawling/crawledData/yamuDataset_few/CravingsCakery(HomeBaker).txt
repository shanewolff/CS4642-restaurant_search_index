yamu_review: ['Cravings Cakery has been taking ', " by storm with their\xa0very impressive artsy cakes - from dollar bills to minions\xa0to everything. They don't deliver, but you can pick up your order from their location in Colombo 5.", 'We placed an order for a\xa0batch of cupcakes - 4 emoji cupcakes (Rs 140 each), 4\xa0vanilla cupcakes (Rs 80 with buttercream and Rs 90 with coffee frosting), 2 vanilla chocolate chip cupcakes (Rs 110)\xa0and 2 chocolate cupcakes (Rs 100 each). I was not too sure about whether my weird assortment of an\xa0order would be taken because most home bakers usually stick to only one type to avoid the hassle, but Cravings was pretty accommodating.', "The chocolate cupcakes were my favorites of the whole lot. The cake was moist which is a great thing if you are Mr.ChocolateCupcake. The frosting, which had a dark chocolatey flavour to it along with a trace of coffee, tasted pretty decadent and rich. Personally, I liked the slight coffee sensation with the chocolate, but if you don't like coffee or if you have a personal feud with coffee beans, this might not work for you.", '\xa0', 'The only difference between these two types of cupcakes was the little bits of chocolate chips that were thrown in. With the chocolate chips dissected, the cakes were\xa0not of the best of what I have had in the past few years of injecting baked flour + sugar in my body. The texture was a little too hard for my liking.', 'I like my vanilla cakes like my heart\xa0-\xa0soft.', 'On a scale of 1 to 10 on the softness meter, they get a 7.', 'For frosting, we witnessed a coffee frosting and your basic buttercream. The coffee frosting tasted of\xa0strong coffee. So caffeine on point! The buttercream icing, on the other hand, was\xa0tad too sweet for my liking, but then again, buttercream frosting is usually butterdiabetescream.', 'Cravings Cakery is undoubtedly one of the more artsy cake artists in Colombo. Their emoji cupcakes looked cuter and more adorable in real life. This was a\xa0moist chocolate cupcake topped with a chocolate frosting followed by fondant. *enter thumbs up emoji here*', 'Cravings Cakery, judging by their Instagram, specialises in custom orders for cakes more than cupcakes, and from my experience, they do chocolate cupcakes justice.', '\r\nIn conclusion, if you want a cake with a minion farting out unicorns, Cravings Cakery can sort something out for you.']
