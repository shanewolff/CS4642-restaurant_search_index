yamu_review: ['Latitude at Taj Samudra offers one of the more expensive lunch buffets in Colombo. While they don’t particularly specialise in a particular area, they offer a satisfying spread overall.', 'At Rs. 2450 nett, the lunch buffet at Latitude is one of the pricier options in town. It falls in a median point in terms of spread somewhere between the likes of ', ' and ', ' at the upper end of the spectrum. They do, however, offer a good variety of preparations. One area they were lacking was in the carbs with a choice of just steamed rice and noodles.', 'We were impressed by the salad spread, which we’d say falls just a bit short of Mt. Lavinia Hotel. One area that they did have most others beat was the pre-prepared salads which were excellent. ', 'For cured meats they had smoked beef, rolled chicken and pork salami. We tried each and they were all fine, but nothing to write home about. Going back to those salads, we loved the beef and asparagus salad, which was fresh, tasty and worked well with the thousand island dressing.', 'Looking at the mains, while the choice of carbs were disappointing, the meats and seafood offered a nice contrast of preparations and cuisines.', 'Our favourite among the meats was the roasted pork loin with peach sauce which was cooked to perfection. The fat was also rendered beautifully so that each slice just melts in your mouth.', 'The Chinese chilli crab while cooked well, lacked a balance of flavours,\xa0 and could have done with a bit more sweetness to counteract the chilli. One thing we did appreciate was that it was presented in a way that you could scoop up the crab meat with a spoon, so no messy hands.', 'The oddly named coconut fried chicken was pretty much a batter fried chicken lollipop with chilli onion sambol. The batter itself is quite spicy but the chicken was very tender, so the textures work well.', 'They had a sizeable dessert spread, but once again we felt like there could have been a bit more to choose from seeing how they do charge more than others.', 'The positive is that most of the desserts were quite good. Our favourites were the dried fruit florentine, with it’s nice crunch complemented by the flavour of the fruits, and secondly the layered blueberry panna cotta which wasn’t overly sweet and had good mix of textures.', 'In general, the Interior of Taj looks great with the high ceilings, large pillars and marble floors. Latitude, however, is a bit dull in comparison, and could use a bit of a facelift, especially in terms of their furniture which just looks boring and uninspired.', 'The service was one area we couldn’t really fault. The waiters were friendly,\xa0 very attentive and carried themselves professionally.', 'The buffet at Latitude does many things right with some tasty salads and meat dishes, but we feel like they need to offer a bit more for their price point.

I would go back for sure. The waiters were the most professional, I have met in Sri Lanka yet. Great service but did not feel pretentious.  The atmosphere  as far as the clientele felt a bit stuffy, business men meeting clients. I'll try dinner next time.  Three stars seems  a bit hard but I get it.  I think they can kick it up with more variety. Thanks for the review.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    CHOWHOUND DISASTER I am not sure if Taj  by Vivanta in Bentota is the same management, but went there today for lunch buffet. It was awful and extremely overpriced. Basically it was a salad buffet and desert. NOTHING else. I had better salad selections in my high school school salad bar. We had to order a couple ala carte dishes that were awful  and unbelievably small.  The salad buffets cost  3000 each and two ala carte dishes  cost 3400.  5 Star, hotel what a joke. No comparison to Taj in Colombo.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    There\'s no forum for Taj Samudra lobby but I will jump in here if I may. Anyway what I want to say is that it is terrible for tea. A group of us ladies went there for a reunion tea and one of us was told by a hotel staff member that a platter (3 plates) was sufficient for two people. However, it was not. What is mostly important here is quality above quantity. There were more sweets than savories, and both were of bad quality. All the short eats were tiny, the pastries were dry and insubstantial. - …Four platters were ordered for 8 people, and we noted that some platters had a certain item while others were minus these! e.g There were two mousse cups on one platter, while the other platters had one. When we asked the waiter for more mousse, our request was ignored. When we explained to the waiter that the platters were not consistent, we pointed out to him that some platters had a certain item on them while others did not have this item. The waiter smiled sheepishly, and muttered "ah" or something like that and walked off!', '\nOne lady did not get a napkin so she asked for one. But again the request was ignored. We did not wish to complain to management as we did not want unpleasantness during a reunion.

Mr Bishan use your brain. They even serve liquor . This is so pathetic. I have scene this in other pages too , people are asking if it is halal or not knowing that they serve liquor and pork. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Went for the buffet on 2016/07/22.  Big disappointment.   Quality of the items is very mediocre.  At 2226.17 bucks it was insulting.   A watered down long island iced tea cost 1490, and a cosmopolitan was 695.

Only good thing is the ambiance.  \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The worst dinner buffet i have been to. food was crappy, raw cooked, not much of a variety, certain dishes was dry, no service, and the buffet was a friday night BBQ buffet, we get the food after 1 hour from the requested time and they were all raw. need a major improvement. \n                                            ']
