name: Heaven's Kitchen
excerpt: Heaven's Kitchen, which apparently used to be called Hell's Kitchen, is a small but obviously successful bath kade in Rajagiriya, just past the junction down the Borella-Rajagiriya road where it snakes towards Buthgamuwa Road and the Fairmount/Fairway apartments. They have an excellent pork curry.
