name: Shanghai Terrace
excerpt: Shanghai Terrace is a Chinese Restaurant that recently opened up in Ethul Kotte. They serve up some good looking Chinese food at a reasonable price. There is a charming little terrace on the roof top (hence the name Shanghai Terrace) accompanying a slightly dodgy looking bar. The service was really good and the food - not too bad either.

Everything we ordered was salty.  The pepper pork was drowned in soya sauce and we had to send it back.  The waiter took it back and brought it back in 5 mins - just as nasty and salty.  They had just re-heated it and served on a new platter.  They had tried to imitate the other Chinese place like Peach and Sunlight with the sizzling tofu - but there was no sizzle and it was cold when brought to the table - and again salty salty salty!  Cook must be eating betel leaves so cant taste the salt.  I will never recommend this place to anyone.  ', '\r\n\n                                    ']

The pick of the menu for me are: Prawn Salad, Fried Green tea chicken and The sizzling fish with egg white and onions, you cannot go wrong with them. The upstairs terrace is nice to entertain and no corkage being charged is a bonus.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    There is this starter platter with five items, that's awesome!!!!

The cuttlefish had a very soft texture of  mushrooms.The Malaysian style seafood fried noodles was a terrible. It was dark brown in color, had a very odd taste and we could not find any seafood in that. The sizzling prawns with Chinese chilies was again very "ordinary". You expect something more from a place like this. The chicken with roasted garlic and vegetables had lots of vegetables and very little chicken and was again very bland.  Only thing OK, was the chicken wanton soup and the pac choi with black mushroom. Overall it was a very disappointing. For the exorbitant prices they charge we certainly got a raw deal. Also, this place does not allow local liquor which is kind of discriminatory. The only thing I really enjoyed was the mint chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

They say they have a chinese cook but he doesn't represent chinese cuisine at all.

If you google you can find the proper recipe for Lemon Chicken (Was with lot of sauce to make the dish taste lemon)-Disgusting. Sticky rice with Pork Belly - Ruin the whole dish with lot of soya sauce. Fish cake not crispy and soft. Service was nil. Very first person who served doesn't know what he was talking. We asked is there a possibility to have salad with little bit of chicken garnish and little bit of shichuan on pork belly. He was saying can't. And we had to wait for long time for our food. I must say second gentleman who served is good. We paid around 5000/= and has to leave two dishes unattended hence how the taste was ruined our appetite. Not worth the price at all. If you mark a high price your food should be exceptional.
