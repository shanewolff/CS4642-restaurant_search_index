excerpt: A great place to cool off. Pun intended. 
yamu_review: ['Snow Monkey has moved from their outlet in Kollupitiya to the Food Station on\xa0Vinyalankara Mawatha. They have been operating there since last year and it has become a crowd favorite.\xa0', 'They have exactly 10 flavors from which you can choose from, such as Bluemist, Blackcurrant, Nelli, Spearmint etc. You can try more than one flavor so it depends on your preference.\xa0', 'We tried 3 separate flavors. The small cup is at Rs. 100 and the large one is Rs. 200.\xa0', 'The ice melts pretty fast but they do give you straws so you can eat and drink at the same time.\xa0', 'Their service was efficient albeit not the most pleasant, which I understand, the heat does not help.\xa0', "The ambience is the same as it had always been at the food station; simple and spacious. The street noise might be a downside as well as the fact that it is not air-conditioned. It didn't bother us considering what we were having, but I could see how uncomfortable it could be if you want to enjoy some kottu from ", '.', "We really like Snow Monkey. Quite frankly, Colombo needs to expand on this concept because we all know how\xa0hot it can get here. If you ever wanna cool off, there's really no better way than ingesting ice, so check them out.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    If you ever wanna cool off, there's really no better way than ingesting flavored ice.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Snow Monkey is perfect for a hot day in Colombo (which is everyday)\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ඔන්න ස්නෝ කෝන් සංස්කෘතියත් ලංකාවට ඇවිල්ලලු. \n                                                                                                                            ']

They have only 7 seats in the floor area but I think it's not the type of place which is generally packed. A nice tumblr-ish photo wall is made, just for photos, which is pretty cool. There was a drawing book where you can draw doodles and stuff, which was probably the most fun addition. And finally, nice staff. \n                                    "]
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    A few of my friends from office went down to this place and had  the refreshment which was quite good. The sales staff gave us a loyalty card saying that the next time we came we get one free (We actually took his word ignoring the back of the card, actually stupid of us as well). Dropped in the next day since it was close to our office and I did not get anything free. The sales persons answer was MY BAD with a very unfriendly smile. Damn foolish of me for believing which was too good to be true. So adding this comment just so people know that the product is not everything, the customers trust also runs a long way. Wont be heading down their anymore\n                                            ']
