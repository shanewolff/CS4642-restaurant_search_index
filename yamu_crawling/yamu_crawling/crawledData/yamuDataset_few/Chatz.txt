The burger that was served to me was small (The bread was good) and the portion of the french fries were just not that adequate and the coleslaw presented looked something that was just put for presentation, that was small in portions size too. There was only one beef patty and it was not a patty to be honest, it looked like two meatballs smashed together. It had some oily skin part which was like between the meat, it was so leathery and i had to just collapse the burger and eat the patty (more like murder it with my knife and fork) and eat it (viciously bite it for like 4 minutes) but I could not swallow it down being afraid that I was going to choke on it so I just put it back on the plate. I know it\'s not a very pleasant thing to do but I had to do it under the circumstances and to show them the struggling I had. The egg on the burger was an really over salty omelette. There was no sauce or condiment that made the burger give at least some proper taste that I used the ketchup they gave in a small saucer on the plate for the small portion of french fries. The choice of meat was really disgusting. The patty was also over salted as well. Worst burger I had from a "fancy" place.

Half way through the meal a tiny piece of metal inside the burger was poked into my husbands gum. Obviously we informed the manager, and the owner too came and apologized.
