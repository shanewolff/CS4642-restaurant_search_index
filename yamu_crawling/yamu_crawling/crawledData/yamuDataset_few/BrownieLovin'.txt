name: Brownie Lovin' 
excerpt: Brownie Lovin' is one of Colombo's awesome brownie bakers. The brownies are extremely gooey and chocolatey, and affordable. 
yamu_review: ["Brownie Lovin' is a great home baker that specializes in baking brownies. We just tried two of their concoctions and we absolutely loved them, probably the gooeyest brownies we've had in a long time.\xa0", "They do a handful of special recipes that seem to work well, using favourites like strawberries, coconut, cookies and M&Ms. It's all priced at around Rs. 700, for six pieces in a box. We got this menu off ", " where you can stay tuned for menu updates. We got their classic and popular 'Talk Dirty To Me', an extra gooey chocolatey brownie, and the 'Funfetti' which incorporates M&Ms and sprinkles (Rs. 750 each). ", "This is a home-baker so unfortunately they don't deliver. You have to order a day in advance and go to Wellawatte to pick your order up.", "Besides Brownie Lovin' the only brownies I really love are at ", ' and ', ' (both make ready-to-go brownies), but ', " is also known for their killer brownies. Let us know if you've had amazing brownies elsewhere.", "Our brownies came surprisingly very warm (the best way to have your brownies). The Talk Dirty To Me brownies are a gooey mess, in the best way, with a creamy thick, sweet chocolatey layer on top, and a squishy moist cakey center, and everything is thoroughly drenched in chocolate. It's one of those things you wake up from hours later, after passing out from a sugar coma.", "The Funfetti is a lot of fun to eat, and ideal if you've got a kid you want to surprise with brownies. Again, sweet, gooey soft brownies, covered in colourful sprinkles and M&Ms. This is much sweeter than the ordinary brownies for obvious reasons.", "Brownie Lovin' is a legit choice if you're looking for excellent, soft brownies slathered in obscene amounts of chocolate. Considering quality and quantity, their prices are good too.\xa0"]
