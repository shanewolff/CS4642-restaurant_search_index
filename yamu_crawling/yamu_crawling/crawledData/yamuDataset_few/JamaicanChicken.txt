name: Jamaican Chicken
excerpt: A random hole-in-the-wall shop selling full and half portions of grilled chicken. Alas, definitely NOT Jamaican Chicken.
yamu_review: ['Jamaican Chicken is a little (literally) hole-in-the-wall shop that sells grilled chicken and a few burgers, for Rs. 200 - 800. A whole grilled chicken is Rs. 790.', "While this spot\xa0does have space to let you eat in, whether you'd want to is a completely different matter.", "There's the grill with a few\xa0chickens impaled on it, and the fire is off until you go and order some, and then the meat is left to slowly rotate\xa0in that oven for a bit more.", 'You can either ask for a whole or a half portion, half being Rs. 400 and a full being Rs. 790. Since we were already there, we ordered a half portion of the chicken and then a chicken burger (Rs. 200) for take away.', "Given that the chicken was slowly roasting in both the midday heat and over a slow fire for a while, it was quite moist and tender, rubbed down with pepper, salt, and a bit of chili. There was definitely no Jamaican Jerk involved, and the meat didn't pack\xa0any heat, just well seasoned.", "The burger was bland and something you'd get if you unenthusiastically heated a frozen chicken patty and placed it between two burger buns with a salad leaf and some ketchup in between. Like something you'd get off a random podi-bakery, basically.", "If you want to get some whole, ready-made grilled chicken to suddenly host a bunch of friends and family, you can stop by here and pick it up. We can't really vouch for the cleanliness, but the nice uncle sitting alone there wore gloves while packing it up for us. But only on one hand."]

The whole point of the Jamaican flavour is the blandness inherent and ask any self respecting Jamaican or Bajan for that matter and they will nod in approval. being a resident from the vicinity I can most certainly vouch for their cleanliness and of course hygiene. my humble opinion is that this little joint could give burgers king and street burgers a good run for their money. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Sounds depressing to me.', "\r\nBut it doesn't look like a literal hole in the wall. \n                                            "]
