yamu_review: ['August By Mama Aida’s is the newest addition to Colombo’s Middle Eastern restaurant repertoire. With authentic dishes, exceptional service and a chic, relaxing setting, August makes for a memorable experience.', 'Looking back at all the Middle Eastern restaurants Colombo has hosted over the years, we’ve never really been blown away in terms of ambience, but August did just that. They share the space with Shirohana on Dudley Senanayake Mawatha, and while it’s not a very large space they’ve definitely made the most of it. We loved how they combined simple elements like tasteful wooden furniture, hanging vines and candlelit lamps to really create a sophisticated and relaxing atmosphere. It’s one of the best outdoor dining experience we’ve had this year, however, there’s only a small section with a roof so rain can be a real spoiler.', 'From the staff to the owners, the folks at August were incredibly hospitable and welcoming. The waiters were attentive and the management checked back on the table a couple of times to make sure our meal was going along well and to ask if we needed to know anything about the dishes. We were there relatively early (around\xa0 7 PM) so only a few other tables were occupied, but it was filled to capacity by the time we were heading out. In terms of service time; our five dish mezze combination came to the table in under ten minutes which was very impressive, while the mains took just a bit longer.', 'We’re no strangers to Mama Aida’s stuff, so we sorta knew what to expect going in to the meal. That being said, they have changed things up quite a bit with August, stepping out of that home cook niche. Just like Mama Aida’s, August isn’t cheap with the price per head coming to Rs. 2000+, especially if you compare it to a more casual Middle Eastern eatery like ', '. However, it is a more complete dining experience considering the setting and quality of service and ingredients.', 'Right now they’re ', ' but they do offer take away for lunch. We really appreciated the concise menu here. They don’t try to do too much but they’ve still managed to add variety in the form of some unique dishes, using unconventional ingredients like lotus seeds and pomegranate, but you’ll also find most of the staples like hummus, babaganoush and falafel, along with all the different breads.', 'Just out of curiosity we tried out their Arabic coffee (Rs. 200) while waiting for our food, and it turned out to be quite pleasant. The coffee itself was fine, with a nice aroma and no real bitterness, but what really made this special was the infused cardamom which really added a new dimension of flavour and light sweetness, which we enjoyed.', 'The hummus (Rs. 450) at August is a bit milder than some of the other iterations around Colombo, though that isn’t a negative by any means. The smoothness of the hummus combined, with the texture of the chickpeas makes for a nice contrast with the olive oil really bringing the two together. The paprika also adds a subtle tartness which counteracts the creaminess of the hummus, though we did wish there was a bit more of it.', 'The baby red mullet with tahini sauce (Rs. 700) was an interesting preparation, and while fish lovers will enjoy this, it may not be for everyone since the fish isn’t deboned. We got three fried baby mullets along with pita chips, topped with tahini sauce and a sprinkling\xa0of paprika. The fish itself was cooked perfectly moist on the inside with a light, crispy batter further complemented by the pita chips. The flavour of the fish was delicate with that nutty and lightly bitter tahini sauce really adding the punch. The bones really did sully the experience a bit though, so it’s definitely something to keep in mind.', 'Our pick of the mezze was without a doubt the slow cooked lamb (Rs. 850). For the price this is a pretty small portion, but man was this ever good. The slow cooked meat was tender and moist, almost melting in the mouth with a texture similar to that of pulled lamb. The seasoning and spice was also just right with the savouriness balanced by the bursts of freshness from the pomegranate seeds. We were a bit reluctant to get this but we’re so glad we went with management’s recommendation on this.', "We have to mention that we weren’t huge fans of how the beef shawarma (Rs. 600) was served. They bring just the meat and you need to get bread separately. This is how shawarma is done in some places, but we're still used to having it served as sort of a wrap. Taste wise the beef preparation was very intense in terms of spices, which is nice, just be aware of how it's presented.\xa0", 'August offers just three mains, which is a refreshing change from the usual cases where they try to do way too much. You won’t find any rice on the August menu, so we opted for the August roast beef with couscous (Rs. 1650). In the case of the beef, they go for a similar preparation to that of the lamb, but with a bit of added gravy which helped keep meat from drying out. The pomegranate was present with this one as well, helping maintain the acid balance of the dish. The well spiced gravy along with the peppery beef make for interesting combo, though it does need the couscous to mellow down the intensity.', 'We also had the chicken yasser with lotus seed (Rs. 1550), which was the first time I’ve ever had the latter. Just by the aroma of the chicken, I knew we were gonna like this one and this chicken preparation is likely to appeal to local tastebuds. With both a flavoursome gravy and dry spice rub, this chicken was packing tons of flavour with just a tinge heat as well. The lotus seed was actually quite dry on it’s own but made for a winning combination when with that thick chicken gravy. It seems like it’s an acquired taste, especially since the texture of the lotus seed is closer to a gram than it is to a carb, but it’s certainly makes for an unique shift from the norm.', 'For dessert, the August mess (Rs. 550) just sounded too good to pass up. I mean c’mon it’s a meringue with chopped strawberries\xa0and pistachios. With a great balance of acidity to sweetness from the fruits and a multitude of textures from the pistachios and meringue, this was an excellent way to end the meal.', 'Colombo’s had a bad track record with so many Middle Eastern restaurants closing down, but August brings a new look and feel to the table and we’re pretty sure they’ll be around for a while. They’re pricey, but you’re getting well executed dishes with high quality of ingredients, some novel dishes and a level of finesse that’s not often associated with Middle Eastern food in Colombo.']

For the price I paid, I expect better manners than pushing a bill to be paid before the time lapsed of our reservation! We inquired if we can sit on a couch and finish our coffee… to which the lady abruptly reminds us of reservation time slots and that we have already overstayed our timing by 10 minutes. She insisted there were guests waiting, so we gulped our coffee and walked out… My friend and I ended up chatting outside the restaurant for another 30 minutes… to our surprise, our very much demanded seats were NOT occupied by anyone!! Shame on the management! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Service is quick and attentive. Possibly the quickest I've seen in Sri Lanka. But that does NOT make it good service. ", "\nIt's purely because the staff has been instructed to quickly push away the customers before the next seating.", '\n', "\nI've been there on three occasions, and twice, it was for the early seating.", '\n', '\nOn both occasions, they brought the mains while we were still consuming the entrees.  And God forbid that we order any desserts. ', '\n', "\nThe place is good to serve some hungry puppies who'd want to eat as fast as possible, but not humans who'd want to dine at a sensible pace and eat their courses while they are still warm", '\n', '\nP.S - Went for the late sitting and everything was nice. The staff was relaxed and our mains were brought 7 minutes (as opposed to 1 minute) after the entree.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    We tried all of the food mentioned above and  they were excellent. They are no scrimping on things. The hoummous and BBG had a lovely smoky flavor.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I too agree with one commentator on here that there is much to be desired in terms of hospitality at this restaurant.  Me and my family were reminded as soon as we started our dinner, that the next party will be arriving at such and such a time. The young lady in charge also prompted us right after we finished dessert, to pay the bill. And she brought it for us.  Never before at a local restaurant has this happened to us. ', '\n', '\nThe food was ok. The chicken  samosas were good. The fried mullet just ok. The chicken dish one of us had, was said to be nothing much.  The dessert August mess tasted good, but it was not really strawberries , it looked like jam really.

It saved them about 5 minutes (I was finishing my coffee anyway) but cost them a lot of good will - completely at odds with any idea of hospitality.  We were a table of two at the later sitting (8.45 till 11pm, we were told), so there wasn't anyone waiting for our table, and it was only 10.20pm when we were essentially told to leave. It's an amateurish and unfriendly gesture that can be easily changed (the waiters were excellent, so this was clearly a management decision to give unasked-for bills). \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Enjoyed the excellent food - coffee was amazing. Could drink that all day. Service super fast, but we felt rushed even though we were on the second sitting. No time to finish and enjoy the mezze before the main arrived, all crammed onto the small table. Maybe it's time for a slightly bigger place :)\n                                            "]
