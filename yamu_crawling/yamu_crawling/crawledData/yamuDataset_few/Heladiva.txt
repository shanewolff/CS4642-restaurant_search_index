user_comments: ['\n\n                                    You guys should definitely check out B-Leaf restaurant at Rattnapitiya junction at Borelasgamuwa. A fantastic place to have an authentic Sri Lankan meal served on a banana leaf with great atmosphere. Think Nuga gama in a much smaller scale. I would definitely take a foreign friend to this place to experience authentic Sri Lankan cuisine. Chicken rice n curry 180 Pork - 190. They have fresh fruit juices and curd and treacle for dessert!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Thanks for the kind words ! My father-in-law is a part owner of the restaurant and my dad owns the house - its a family affair ;) On bahalf of the Ratnayakes and Senanayakes, we are glad you enjoyed the food and the premises. Please do come again.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    What do they have for B' Fast?", '\r\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    rating ;0/5. Mediocre to the extreme good ingredients but zero cooking technique. I guess it's so cheap customers do not mind the tasteless food which is over salted to compensate for the flies. Yamu award to this dump as a bastion of Lankan tradition is an insult to the tradition.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Hey feldallen, we last visited this place 3 years ago, so we're not sure what they're like now. Also, you can rate restaurants on the site itself (look at the upper right hand of your screen next to the restaurant name)!\n                                            "]
