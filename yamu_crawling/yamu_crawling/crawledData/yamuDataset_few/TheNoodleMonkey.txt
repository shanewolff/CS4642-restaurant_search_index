excerpt: The Noodle Monkey is a new cafe on Haig Road by Don Stanley's group. While their food has its merits, they've tried to do too much with the menu and the entire operation lacks direction.

While their food has\xa0its merits, they've tried to do too much with the menu and the entire operation lacks direction.", "We're no strangers\xa0to Don Stanley's group of restaurants.\xa0", ', ', ' and ', " have all fared pretty well in our books. I'm not quite sure how, but they've managed to fit another restaurant into the same space that houses the aforementioned eateries. While the other three specialize in certain areas (seafood, Mongolian and\xa0bakery, respectively), Noodle Monkey tries to do a bit of everything, which is sort of where they drop the ball. Their menu features\xa0everything from Sri Lankan to Italian to Thai, but unlike their other restaurants, doesn't really excel at any of them. Most of their dishes are priced under Rs. 1,000.\xa0But most of their mains are upwards of Rs. 700, which isn't exactly cheap when it comes to\xa0a cafe."]
