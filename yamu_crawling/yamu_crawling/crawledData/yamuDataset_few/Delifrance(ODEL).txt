Even the foreigner pointed out that i was in first and he got so embarrassed by all of this nonsense. In Sinhala there is a really good saying but then i did not say it there it there nor i would not type it here.  \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    One of the worst experiences ever… nothing much to mention about food.
