It's run by one family, the aunties are all sisters or sisters-in-law. Not sure if things have changed, but at one time they used to have beef curry, but only the mother would serve that into your lunch, the daughters would serve everything else and keep it aside for her to serve the beef!  :)\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Why do you call everybody aunty, "caterering lady" would be more appropriate!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Better to call caterering lady \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Aunty is more Sri Lankan ;)', '\r\n\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    @Jannike: Yeap, it's more Sri Lankan. and considered more respectfully way to address an elderly lady (although not traditionally) I think aunty/uncle became mainstream in our generation maybe 30 years back.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    The food was super when the "aunty" was alive. It is not as good now but still better than many. Pity they have stopped the beef and when enquiring whether they had beef the answer "no" made me feel as if I was a criminal asking for beef. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    my fav thing about Bo Sevana is that the rice packets come in 3 different sizes.

I always go for 'Small', so that I don't have to throw food away. : )\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    There are much better places around Nugegoda for lunch packets. Recently bought a packet and there was no taste of any salt put. In fact later they admitted they don't taste the fish/chicken they cook.
