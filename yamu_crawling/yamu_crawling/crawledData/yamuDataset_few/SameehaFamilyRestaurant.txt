name: Sameeha Family Restaurant
excerpt: Sameeha's is popular for their cheese kottu, and is one of THE places to drop into in Negombo.
yamu_review: ["If you have friends who are Negombo/ Katunayake locals, chances are that you've heard them wax eloquent about Sameeha's cheese kottu. I haven't tried any other kottu in the region to know if it's the best, but judging from my research and intense interviews (of like, five people), it can be concluded that Sameeha's is the boss when it comes to Negombo Kottu. What is Sameeha's you ask? A large-ish family restaurant which is open 24/7, and has everything from kottu to subs to shawarmas. How good the rest are, we don't know yet, but their kottu gets a thumbs up from us.", 'We went for their chicken cheese kottu (Rs. 700). Definitely on the pricey side, but the whopping platter they lay on your table is just enough for four hungry adults. Add to that, the kottu is intensely heavy and creamy, and will fill you up within five mouthfulls.', "The strips of rotti\xa0used in it are huge, not the tiny chopped up ribbons of dough we're used to generally getting. These are chunky-dory pieces, with equally chunky bits of chicken in there. Tossed with the usual roots and veggies, keep an eye out for bits of bone as well. It seems to have been boiled with milk at some point, so like I said, it's intensely moist and creamy. Quite delish, and very very filling.", "For drinks, we went for the\xa0Lassi, Faluda, and an Iced Coffee (all of them priced at Rs. 150). The lassi was a bit short of sugar, and the sourness was slightly overpowering. However, given the heatwave we're currently riding though, it was nothing short of refreshing. I found the faluda a tad too saccharine\xa0for my liking, but my friend enjoyed it. My favourite of the lot was the iced coffee, which was sweet and slightly bitter, and icy cold. In all fairness, all the drinks were well chilled, so this is a major plus point.", "Ambience-wise, it's a lot like ", ', Al-Maas, ', " and the likes, but on a much larger and (to all appearances) cleaner scale. They've got a couple of AC\xa0private areas as well. Service is fast, with food and drinks arriving within 15 minutes, but a bit dysfunctional where efficiency\xa0is concerned. We were confused about what was available on the menu and what wasn't, since one or two things we ordered were first forgotten. When we reminded them of it at the end of our kottu, we were informed that it's from the restaurant next door so it would take a bit of time.", "That's\xa0", "\xa0a Sameeha's though, and is\xa0in the same premise, so we're a tad confused. Being stuffed with kottu as it were, we decided to pass up the chicken dish I'd set my eyes on, and save it for next time.", "These guys are open 24/7. Their cheese kottus are the bomb, and they\xa0also come\xa0with seafood. The seafood cheese kottu (from a previous experience) comes with plenty of pieces of fish, prawns, and cuttlefish. It's easy to find, just make sure that you place your order clearly and remind the stewards about it once in a while to prevent confusion.", '\xa0', '\xa0', '\xa0']

After reading this review I and a couple of my friends went there, and the waiter did not come to us for about 15 minutes. When we finally called him and asked for the menu, he just threw it onto our table. No respect at all for their customers and we just left.

Probably the worst I’ve ever experienced. The delivery driver nor sameeha provide any real ETA. Two days in a row iv had food arrive an 1hour n 45mins after the order when i was promised a 25-30min delivery. Asked around and people seem to have similar experiences. \n                                            ']
