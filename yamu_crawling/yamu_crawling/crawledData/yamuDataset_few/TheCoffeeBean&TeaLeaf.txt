user_comments: ["\n\n                                    I like the place.  The service is very friendly.  But the food and drink both have a mass-produced feel and the food portions are definitely on the small side.  I've had some very poor dishes at breakfast time.  I think its popularity is because of all that comfortable seating and the fact that you can sit there all afternoon, doing your work or reading your papers, without anyone hassling you to buy another drink - just reaching for another latte when you feel like it.  The place is big, and there's always a buzz.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    If you wanna kill sometime…or if u wanan talk with someone over a coffee, or if  u wanna have a quality time with urself then this is the place.

Once I was there and I took out my camera to take a few photos and this very stern looking man appeared by my side and said "Pictures not allowed madam !" I was obviously very offended and I asked him why not and he said because it\'s a franchise. Every time I touched my camera he would find his way to our table as if he had been watching me and repeated that photographs were not allowed. I didn\'t go back for a good year or so until my husband insisted. I really like their Rosemary chicken sandwich. But I still hold a grudge. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    We didn't actually ask, so they probably just didn't notice!

I don't really understand what the great threat to the franchise is - everyone's instagramming everything they eat these days. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    still better than the overhyped starbucks\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    In my opinion this is the best coffee shop in Colombo\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    you missed Barista!!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    i too agree with AZI….Best coffee served in Barista…and good price too…\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Love coffee beans and teal leaves at WTC, I go there very often… guys you should try chicken lasagna with sausages…don't forget to add sausages … taste amazing, coffee is good…setting is ok no complaints, prices are pretty high compared to Costa Coffee ( not here / coffee beans in New Delhi ) but the quality is really good…\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    always the enjoyed the coffee, service as well as the ambience.

The parfait was nasttyyy - a tablespoon of yogurt to 10 tablespoons of muesli ratio. The drinks are regular…I really started missing Starbucks in the middle of my sip.
