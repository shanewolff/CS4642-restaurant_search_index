name: Amrith
excerpt: Amrith has moved to a new location. The food is still consistent and while they aren't the best in town, they're still a valid option for Indian food.
yamu_review: ["Amrith's move\xa0was a good excuse to review the restaurant once again.", "They recently relocated to De Fonseka road in lieu of Qbaa. The new place is spacious. So spacious, it looked empty when we visited it\xa0for lunch this week. We assume (and hope) Amrith\xa0is busier at dinner time. If any of you has an input about that, please let us know, we're curious.", "Quite baffled by the lack of crowd, we hesitantly ordered some food and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. While it won't blow your mind away, we can safely say Amrith\xa0has been\xa0serving some decent\xa0Indian food over the years.", 'Puzzled by their substantial yet coherent menu, we asked the waiter for recommendations so we could\xa0have a good overview of their food.', "We blindly followed his advice\xa0and ended up with a Chicken Biryani (Rs. 990), Chicken Tikka Masala (Rs. 800), Veg Kolapuri (Rs. 490) and Butter Naans (Rs. 160). The dishes were almost equally tasty,\xa0spicy and filling. It was definitely enough for the two of us, we couldn't even finish it all.", "Let's start with the\xa0chicken biryani, the crowd\xa0favourite. It was good. The rice was fragrant and flavoursome. The gently spiced chicken was well cooked: it was tender and falling off the bone. All in all, the chicken biryani was delicate and not greasy, which we appreciated.", 'We tried another classic, the chicken tikka masala. Here again, nothing to complain about, the dish was properly executed.\xa0The chicken was tender and moist.\xa0And the creamy gravy\xa0was rich and well balanced in terms of herbs and spices.', "The\xa0veg kolapuri was a bit behind though. Not that it was a bad dish but the flavours, texture and spices weren't quite there. The gravy was not as smooth and creamy as the chicken tikka masala, and was heavier on oil and spices. Not the best pick but still alright.", '\r\n', "The butter naans did not disappoint us. They were fresh, light and generously buttery. Can't really ask for more!", "To accompany our meal, we went for a cup of Masala Tea (Rs. 300). I couldn't\xa0resist trying it when it was on the menu.\xa0It was definitely worth the price given that there was more than enough of the spicy beverage for two. I would rate it as a good, honest, masala tea. A lot of flavours and spices were going on in the cup and the expected spice\xa0kick was present. It was a bit too sweet to my taste but yet again I'm not that much of a sweet tooth.\xa0", 'As I mentioned, Amrith was uninvitingly empty the day we visited it. Needless to say that the ambience\xa0was\xa0not as\xa0lively as it used to be on a Friday night at\xa0Qbaa.\xa0You would probably love the ambience if you are agoraphobic though.', "While the location is new, Amrith\xa0still displays their same old Indian influenced theme. Some paintings and plants here and there and comfy chairs at the entrance\xa0create\xa0somehow a homely atmosphere.\xa0Bonus point for their copper dishes and water cups which I've found pretty nice\xa0and original.\xa0", 'Service at Amrith\xa0was effective and pleasant.\xa0Our food and drinks were served in a timely manner. The staff was discreet and\xa0cordial.\xa0', 'Apart from the\xa0new location, nothing really new. All in all, Amrith\xa0remains a safe choice\xa0for decent classic Indian food at a reasonable price.', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Good old Amrith has been part of the Indian restaurant scene in Colombo for a while now.
