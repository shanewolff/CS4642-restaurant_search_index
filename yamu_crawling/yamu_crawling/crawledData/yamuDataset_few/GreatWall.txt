name: Great Wall 
excerpt: Great Wall has been around for a while now, but they're mostly known for their take out. We dropped by for lunch to see how they match up against the growing number of Chinese restaurants in Colombo.

We went there last week for the first time and the place was almost empty. We were waiting for a waiter to take our order and finally got the attention of someone who look like the manager. He was trying to tell us to wait in sign language and was just standing there. Then there was a waiter laying cutlery on a table that was empty. We finally got his attention to be treated the same as by the manager. So we sat through till he completed laying cutlery on two tables with around 6 chairs each (both empty mind you), taking his time to do it perfectly and he finally came to take the order. As mentioned in the review he had a blank expression on his face, so did everybody else. By this time I was fuming and didn't bother too much about the taste or quality of the food.
