excerpt: Best yellow rice and curry you will ever have!  
yamu_review: ['Kaha Bath Gedara is a home-based business\xa0primarily doing delivery and takeaway but they will be opening up an outlet soon (which we eagerly await!).', 'You can place your order via their ', ' page or\xa0call/text this number (077 786 2672).', 'Lunch orders should be placed before 9 am and dinner orders before 3 pm. You can either pick it up from their home or get it delivered. They are very responsive and the process is super smooth and easy. Minimum order is 4 packs.', "In terms of food, they don't have a\xa0wide selection but what they do have is brilliantly prepared and unpretentious. There's prawn, fish and chicken yellow rice along with Chocolate Biscuit Pudding for dessert. We ordered three rice packs, one of each.\xa0They also have Pilau and Sawaans. The food is cooked by their mum, so obviously it's made with love.", 'The Prawn Rice (Rs. 450) was delightful! Aside from the prawns, there was batu moju, fish cutlet, tempered potato, a boiled egg and a mixture of papadam, murukku and kaju.', "The samba rice was cooked well with a fair amount of turmeric spice. The prawns were excellently spiced with their shells removed so it was easy to bite into. The moju was sweet and delicious. The cutlet was tasty enough with mashed potatoes, fish and green chillies. It wasn't soggy per se but we would have liked it better if it had a crunchier coating. Best of all was that papadam, murukku and kaju mixture which was crispy, crunchy and salty. It spiked up the flavours and made biting a lot less boring.\xa0", 'Next up was the Chicken Rice (Rs. 380) which was equally delicious and salivating. The chicken was just like the one your mum makes; tender and juicy with a spicy gravy. The veggies were the same as before, with the addition of a mango curry which I found to be a bit too sour.\xa0', "The Fish Rice (Rs. 380) was superb! The ambul thiyal\xa0gives you that oomph with perfectly balanced sourness and spicy flavour. It was skillfully prepared that we can only assume they have some connection to Galle (or somewhere around that area) because you can't cook fish this good if you don't know about it well enough.\xa0", "They also know how to balance the spices.\xa0The portion was easily enough for two people and the curries were adequate that we didn't find ourselves left with rice and no curry towards the end.", "The CBP is hands down the best\xa0I have ever tried. With just Rs. 100 this is\xa0an excellent indulgence! The texture was creamy, gooey and chocolatey\xa0with milk-soaked Marie biscuits. It wasn't overly sweet and the roasted, caramelised peanuts balanced out the flavours perfectly.", 'This is undeniably one of the best spots to order\xa0a delicious and filling lunch. You can get all this under Rs. 1500 which is an amazing deal, considering the quality and the quantity of the food. We highly recommend it!', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Delicious yellow rice and curry for your weekend luncheon. \n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    මස්, මාළු කිලෝ ගණන් කියල තියෙන එකක්යැ? ඒ මදිවට, කොළඹට ඩිලිවරි කරන්නත් රු. 400-600ක් ගන්නව. අනේ මන්දා ඉතින්. ඔය පඩි ආපු දවසක, ආසාවට කනව වගේ හැරෙන්න වෙන දවසක නම්… තේරුමක්ම නෑ!\n                                                                                                                            ']

They replied that the order was CONFIRMED as well.', '\n', '\nI wanted my order to be delivered at 12.30 PM. On the day of delivery, since it had not arrived by 12.30 PM, I called them. The response I got was "THERE IS NO SUCH ORDER PLACED". They promised to call me back after I refused to believe this (I even re-checked if I had sent the SMS to the correct number). A few minutes later, a lady called to say "I am the one who takes the orders usually, but this order must have been taken by our madam, but I\'ll deliver it somehow before 1.00 PM".  I decided there must have been a slip-up in their order books and got back to my work (despite being quite hungry).', '\n', '\n1.00 PM ticked by and there was no update. So I called again. This time the response was "We only finished bundling now" while they repeatedly kept saying there was no such order from my number.', '\n', '\nTheir excuses did not end there though. During the call they said, "WE HAVE NO THREE WHEELERS NOW. There\'s heavy traffic as well and all the three wheeler drivers will complain that it\'s difficult for them to deliver the lunch and get back to their stand at this time". This was followed by "YOU CAN CANCEL THE ORDER IF IT\'S TAKING TOO LONG". At this point I was in no mood for this NONSENSE as the delivery was already close to ONE HOUR OVERDUE. I wondered if this is how KAHABATH runs their business, despite marketing themselves as one of the BEST PLACES TO GET A SRI LANKAN LUNCH from.', '\n', '\nAt 1.45 PM,  they finally informed me that the delivery had been dispatched by three wheeler.', '\n', "\nWe eventually received the food at 2.55 PM, by which time we had lost all interest in having lunch. But wait, there's more! When the food arrived, the three wheeler driver asked me for Rs. 600/- (THE DELIVERY CHARGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 200/-)!! The food was by then 2.5 HOURS LATE and the people at KAHABATH didn't even have an OUNCE OF COMMON SENSE to make sure I faced no further hassle!", '\n', '\nTHIS WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN A BIT OKAY IF THE FOOD WAS AT LEAST PALATABLE. It seemed the food had been prepared in a hurry without being PROPERLY COOKED (mind you, one of my colleagues is an expectant mother).', '\n', '\nI felt this meal was not even worth Rs.150/-. They also tried to BRIBE us by sending three (yes, just three despite all this hassle) spoiled (yes, you read that right) biscuit puddings which tasted even worse than the Kahabath.', '\n', "\nWhat do they deliver, food or SICK JOKES?? What's the point of delivering lunch at tea time?

The food was fresh and divine, and the brinjal was one of the best I've had recently! The crunchy peanut/papadam/murukku mixture was favoured by all at home and I'm hoping to try it out myself! And I agree with this review about how the rice to curry ratio is totally on point! I also ordered some Chocolate biscuit pudding as I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, and everyone at my home loved it so much! Thanks Yamu for the recommendation!

Furthermore, the guy forgot to bring the CBP!! The food itself was below average.\xa0 There was enough rice to feed 4 people (we ordered for 2), with very little meat\xa0 (small piece of chicken drumstick, and 2 tiny pieces of fish). Moreover, I was surprised that there was no vegetable?\xa0 Just dhal, cutlet, and an egg!\xa0 Very disappointing Saturday afternoon lunch.\n                                    ', '\n                                            ', '\n                                    ', '\n                                            Lovely authentic sri lankan yellow rice with curries.
