name: Harbour Court (Kingsbury)
excerpt: The Kingsbury buffet is pretty good. It's the best in terms of salads and veg, highly competitive in seafood, and good for everything else. It's Rs. 3,500 all in. We think it's good value.

They also should give a chance for viewers to have their own Yamu to review places that Yamu can't cover. This site has given me great value.

Responded to your comment on FB I think. We've reviewed the Kingsbury multiple times, once as a preview, once for Yue Chuan, Sky Lounge, etc. Treating the buffet as a separate thing, we honestly think it's pretty good. They've focused on seafood and veg and done that well. Regarding the comments on service, it's a buffet and we didn't really encounter that issue, but it could be there.", '\r\n', "\r\nThey do advertise and we're aware that this financial relationship can affect reviews, even subconsciously. Our value (and personality) is in being independent so we try to 1) separate advertising and editorial as much as possible in a small company 2) be transparent, which I suppose we could do a better job at, maybe noting on each post that someone advertises 3) be OK with losing advertisers.", '\r\n', "\r\nWe have lost advertising, distribution, etc over bad reviews and we're OK with that because the strength of the YAMU brand is more important. We're lucky to have advertisers that understand that and users that keep us honest.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    For sure, Kingsbury\'s buffet is good. The salads section is excellent. The sea view and ambience are excellent. Generally, stewards are very friendly. One supervisor or manager can be arrogant at times. Certainly, they have increased the buffet price to around 3,000rps, but with HSBC promotion, it is a good deal. If the buffet is "the crappist in Colombo" as mentioned above, you will never find good buffet in Colombo then. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I was there on last Thursday for dinner and i cant quite agree with the comment  "the crappist in Colombo". The salads corner was excellent and action stations were much better compared to Cinnamon Grand. one thing i hated was the excessive usage of oil to cook the meet.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Very overrated buffet. There seems to a wide choice, but you hardly get anything that tastes any good. It also is very crowded which kind of kills the ambience. Service is very indifferent and they clearly can’t handle the crowd. They didn’t even have parking. The valet parking staff politely asked us to go park at the WTC car park. ', '\r\nA positively awful experience. The Cinnamon Grand Taprobane buffet is way better.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I think it is overrated. I have been for dinner few times and the choice is the same always. The service was a way below expectations last time. The service staff was chatting around without attending to customers. \n                                            ']

directions: Take the Galle Road north until it ends (past the Galle Face Green) at a roundabout. That giant building you're looking at is the Kingsbury. Go inside and proceed towards the ocean till you get to the restaurant.
