name: Pranzo (Waters Edge) 
excerpt: Pranzo has an amazing view and serves pretty good Italian and 'Sritalian' fare.
yamu_review: ['Pranzo is an Italian restaurant at Waters Edge that has both indoor and outdoor seating, with pizzas, pastas, lasagna and even grilled meats on offer, and an amazing view. We dropped in for lunch on a sunny day and opted for the view over the A/C.\xa0', "The staff at Pranzo are attentive and courteous. They'll pull out chairs for you and even insist that you keep your bag on a chair. If you make a mess while eating, they'll promptly clean up the table before serving the next course. I felt quite uncouth, what with breadcrumbs around my plate, but they were really smooth about it, and we liked that.\xa0", "The outdoor setting, though, is what you really ought to go here for. The abundance of green shades that surround you really gets you into a good mood. While they do have an air-conditioned dining area indoors with exposed brick walls, it can't quite compare. You could even sit out on the lawn, if the weather allows for it, and the view of the waters and the greens should keep you quite happy till the food arrives.", "We liked that once you order, they'll serve up a loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar while you wait. Pranzo is meant to be an Italian restaurant, they do have a Sritalian section of their menu with Sri Lankanized options for the discerning palette.", 'We veered away from those options and instead decided to treat ourselves to the Norwegian Salmon under the grilled items. We were quite surprised when the dish arrived with lettuce and pol sambol. The salmon itself was superb.', "Grilled just lightly, the flesh was still juicy and pink on the inside, falling away as we cut through it. The pol sambol\xa0did help bring in that saltiness that us lankans crave for, and didn't take away from the salmon.", "At Rs. 1950, it's a pricey dish, but the quality of the fish seems worth it, especially since they haven't cooked the living colour out of it.\xa0", "The pizza we ordered, Prosciutto e Rucola (Rs. 1,100) was pretty good. We've tried the same at Rocco's recently, and were served a thicker, chewy parma ham, but\xa0this one at Pranzo was easier to bite into.", "The prosciutto\xa0at Pranzo is sliced extremely thin, with a glassy feel to it, and isn't overpowering. It lends a saltiness to the pizza, as a cured meat should, but doesn't taste too fatty. The rocket leaves were fresh, and the pizza was served after it had rested well, so no tongues were burnt. Oh, and we even tried some slivers of the salmon along with the pizza, and it really worked!\xa0", "Pranzo does their own gelato,\xa0with just three flavours: vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. We tried the pistachio and it was an instant hit. Beautifully presented, with some thick honey, glazed pistachio nuts and raspberry compote, there was just enough going on to make each spoonful delicious. The gelato is thick and creamy, doesn't taste too milky, and isn't overly sweet, with a distinct pistachio flavour coming through. Highly recommended! At Rs. 300 per scoop, it's fully worth it.", "Pranzo might not be the best thing at Waters Edge, but it's definitely got one of the best views. We'd go just for that. The food can be quite pricey, costing around Rs. 2000 per head, but if you'd like to indulge yourself, it's worth it. ", ', we learnt that the prawn ravioli is a stellar dish, so do try that, too! \xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The food can be quite pricey, but if you'd like to indulge yourself, it's worth it. \n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Pranzo is the Italian restaurant that just opened at Waters Edge. Colombo could use some good Italian since most of our 'Italian' restaurants specialize in mostly pizza. The food at Pranzo is actually pretty good, there's a view, and you'll be glad to know it isn't over-the-top expensive.\n                                                                                                                            "]
user_reviews: ['\n                                            The pizzas were not of good quality. Hardly had any cheese and chicken in the BBQ chicken pizza. One pizza was not even cut in to pieces and took more than 45 minutes to prepare our pizzas. Was very disappointed with the quality of their food.\n                                    ']
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    Had dinner there last night. Was OK, definitely not great. The beef lasagne was not served like it was to you guys, in a pot with separate sauce etc. it was on a plate as you\'d get anywhere else. More to piont though, it had a "frozen n reheated badly" feel to it. The prawn ravioli was good. Full marks for service including little touches like asking for you valet ticket when paying so you don\'t have to wait half an hour for the guy to get to the rather distant car park.  Ambiance ain\'t great as all the lights in the place were on so it was a bit like being on stage. Is the evening cool, strongly recommend sitting outside. Would I go there again? Probably only if was in the area and wanted a quick bite. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Try out the  special pistachio ice cream!! worth the money  \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Ohhhhhh my… If you like your food, this is the place to visit… Our experience there was amazing. Service was excellent !! And we had what they recommend - which was the lamb shank and their signature seafood ravioli dish. We also had the mushroom soup till we waited for the main meal (we were told, based on what we ordered that it might take a bit longer) … Oohhhh that was the best soup we've had in a long time.  Pranzo gets  two thumbs up from us. We were pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Had dinner at Pranzo tonight. My husband ordered the prawn ravioli and he was delighted with it - their signature dish, and yamu was so right about this dish. Our guest ordered a tuna steak and said it was good, but he may have said it to be polite - i would not know. I did see that the steak was quite raw, and he being Russian may have liked it that way. I being a vegetarian was a bit disappointed because they did not have a vegetarian ravioli which was a great pity. Sri Lanka has great pumpkin, and they could easily outdo the courge filled ravioli of europe. I sent a message to the chef asking that they introduce  a vegetarian ravioli option - i hope they do because more and more people are opting for vegetarian choices. The dessert we ordered was the warm chocolate pudding which was also very good. The ambience was very good (not in the airconditioned section, but outside, overlooking the waters), and the service was good and friendly. The prices were reasonable too. I highly recommended place for dinner, but, one bit of advice to the Chef of Pranzo - add a vegetarian choice to your signature dish - ravioli. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Slow snail pace service. Not attentive, lethargic attitude. However the food was great.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Had dinner at Pranzo last night, it was a disaster. There were neither bread, olive oil nor balsamic vinegar served (maybe YAMU got special treatment). There were 6 of us and they gave us one menu tablet. We ordered drinks first and the waiter didn't know whether they had the beer we ordered from the menu and it took him 15 minutes to serve a Lion larger (we were wondering whether he was bringing it down from a nearby supermarket). ", "\r\nSame goes on the food, ordered, four pizzas tandoori chicken, curry mutton, beef and Romana. We asked the waiter what’s in Romana and he was clueless again. At first they brought the Romana and tandoori chicken pizza. Tandoori pizza was so cold it felt like they have taken it out from the stove 10 minutes ago. All pizzas disappointed us with the scanty toppings. The mutton pizza didn’t have more than 15 tiny mutton cubes scattered around in a pathetic way. The beef pizza had tiny blobs of minced beef (which tasted like curry) here and there. The Romana tasted so ‘fishy’ we weren’t sure if it was anchovies or canned sardine. It pretty much tasted like the latter (BTW the waiter never got back to us on what's in it).", "\r\nWith everyone's recommendation we ordered prawn Ravioli which was super cold by the time it was served. The taste of it reminded us of ‘steamed dumplings’ merged in a Thai curry. ", '\r\nIt’s such a shame they call this Italian food. And to make things worst it wasn’t cheap!!', '\r\n\n                                            ']
