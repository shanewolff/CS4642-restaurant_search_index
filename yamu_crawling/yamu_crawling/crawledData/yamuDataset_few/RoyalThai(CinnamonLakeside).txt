name: Royal Thai (Cinnamon Lakeside)
excerpt: Royal Thai is a great celebratory option. With delicious food and impeccable service, it's definitely one of Colombo's reigning dining royalty.
yamu_review: ["Royal Thai remains the reigning king of Thai food in Colombo. Although the original chef has left the establishment, the food and ambience here is still top notch. It's my new personal favourite for a fully satisfying dinner.", 'We went for some prawn cakes for starters, the seafood pad thai, cuttlefish and beef red curry. The portions are pretty generous, but note that your bill can easily go up to Rs. 6000 for two, if you order wisely we think you can get away with Rs. 4000 for two, which is amazing considering the quality of your dinner.', "The prawn cakes came batter-fried and succulent - perfect, but gone in a few minutes, and five pieces for Rs. 1400 is a lot. We'd suggest you skip starters, as yummy as they are, if you're concerned about your budget. If not, then ball out and enjoy yourself, they're tasty.", 'The pad thai featured a generous heaping of flavorful flat noodles, egg, tofu, veggies and chunks of seafood. It was a perfect mix of flavours, sweet, salty, spicy - rich and filling, and we still had an extra portion left at the end of our meals. The cuttlefish was great too, not rubbery as most places tend to prepare it, spicily accompanied with peppers and a sweet sauce.', "The winner was however the beef red curry - you cannot go wrong ordering this, the meat was tender and there's a lovely juicy explosion of lemongrass as you bite into it and a fragrant emphasis on coconut in the thick gravy.", "I love the interior decor at Royal Thai, everything from the ceramic plates on the walls to the faint sound of stringed Thai instruments to the cutlery. It's a very soothing, well thought-out space, with wood carved and woven partitions and a classy touch of Thai decor. It can get quite full, however, so be sure to make reservations. Service was excellent while we were served our drinks and meals, but unfortunately they forgot about us afterwards, and we had to call the waiters several times to remind them about the bill.", "Royal Thai is one of those rare places where almost everything you order is going to be delicious, whether you have a thing for Thai food or not. I finished my meal and was like I want to go hug the chef. The experience is somewhat expensive but not unreasonably so, considering the quality of ingredients. If you're in the mood for tasty Thai cuisine or just a good group celebration, we'd recommend Royal Thai.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Royal Thai is a great celebratory option.

user_reviews: ['\n                                            Although this restaurant is in a 5 star property this restaurant is nowhere near 5 star standards by any stretch of imagination. For a start, it is terribly understaffed. There is a Supervisor who doesn’t even know the menu, one waiter and two very raw trainees. As a result, there is no one at the entrance to greet, open the door or bid adieu and there is next to no service. You have to wait until the staff appear and then struggle to get their attention. ', '\n', '\nThey are not service oriented either. When ordering the food we made it clear that one of our group was allergic to prawns we told the waiter about the allergy, discussed and ordered a chicken  soup instead of the traditional Tom Yang   soup which has seafood. Nevertheless our pineapple rice dish arrived boldly garnished with prawns atop !', '\n', '\nThe piped music is not Thai and is probably Chinese music from the adjoining restaurant. The lemon grass scented wet towels aren’t offered anymore and the complementary Jasmine tea is not offered unless specifically asked for. ', '\n', '\nThey serve Spirits but strangely and uncharacteristic for a 5 star property, they charge separately for the Soda as in wayside restaurants. Cheap restaurants are justified in doing so because they don’t mark up their spirits the way 5 stars do.  ', '\n', '\nWe had the pineapple rice and it was absolutely tasteless and cold and the steamed rice had obviously been reheated. The traditional green curry was clearly made with a pre-made sauce that had been re-heated many times. As a result the coconut cream had turned into oil and it was oily instead of creamy. The papaya salad was limp and chewy and not crisp and fresh.  ', '\n', '\nThe desserts too were awful: a disproportionate mango sticky rice, and banana fritters made from a rotten banana that was fully black in the centre. The Thai pancake came fried like a samosa.  Each costing around 1,000 bucks a portion', '\n', "\nThis restaurant too reflects the overall drop in standards in the cinnamon group of hotels over the past few years. Here too the hotel's  black jacketed Managers and Supervisors were  breezing in and out with bloated egos, trying to look authoritative but doing nothing, nor observing anything and quite oblivious as to whether the guests were being served well or not.\n                                    ", '\n                                            ', '\n                                    ', '\n                                            I liked it. i went there for lunch with one of my friend in 2016.

The food was  tasty.  I felt a bit overpowered with sweetness. We had the prawn toast, a bit greasy and crispy mushrooms. Then red beef curry, and green chicken curry. Then tamarind cuttle fish, a bit chewy and sweet. Finally, Phad Thai  with pork which was delicious. Prices have gone up. That was 8615 + tip.  I would definitely go back. I thought the green curry was the star. I can't agree with five stars. The food is good but lacks depth of flavor for Thai food. There is room here to get more authentic.
