I fall under the stereotyped American who needs it Super sized as well when it comes to curry. I tend to find most Indian restaurants in the States pretty tight with the portions. But this Sri Lankan gem hit the spot for my curry need. Even though portions were small.  There is not many Sri Lankan restaurants in New York. So I tend to eat at Pakistani or Bangladesh restaurants. There is more Sri lankan food to be found in the outer boroughs ( Queens, Staten Island). The area around Sigiri was known for Americanized Indian food. Ironically, most of the Indian restaurant cooks were Bangladeshi but I did not know any better when I was growing up. I was afraid this was going to be watered down Sri Lankan restaurant . However,  I found it to be authentic. Thanks Shru. I'll be back in Sri Lanka in a couple weeks. I am looking forward to hitting some Yamu recommendations.  I'll try to be kind with my feedback ;)\n                                            "]
