yamu_review: ["They've got 6 rooms spread out through two floors; 4 King\xa0rooms and 2 Queen rooms. The Queen rooms are slightly smaller than the other one. At about 14k - 19k per night, they provide cozy and comfortable rooms with modern,\xa0spotless bathrooms, A/C, Wi-Fi, twin beds, and usually a garden view.", "None of the rooms have TV\xa0or Cable facilities, but there's\xa0a nice lounge upstairs with a very comfy sofa\xa0if you're in a mood to read a book, watch a DVD, or Netflix and chill.\xa0", 'From starters to desserts, the food menu at The Bungalow is quite extensive and covers a range of cuisines that suits\xa0anyone. As for drinks, they’ve got both alcoholic and non-alcoholic ones, including mocktails, cocktails, soft drinks, milkshakes, juices, and coffee.', 'We started off with the Mushroom soup (Rs. 600), which was simply amazing. Hearty, garlicky, oniony, and most important of all, lots and lots of mushrooms. We could taste that in every spoonful. They use three types of mushrooms to make this delicacy; local, shiitake and button mushrooms. The texture of this soup was thick, slightly grainy\xa0and to kick it up a notch, they’ve added freshly crushed pepper to it.', 'We also tried the Crispy Wontons (Rs. 750), which is one of the biggest-sellers in their appetizer section. Puffy, light\xa0and not crazy-oily, it became an instant favorite of ours. They were stuffed with oven roasted chicken, shiitake mushrooms, and spring onions. Paired\xa0with some soy sauce and peanut butter on the side, this is an ideal starter to awake\xa0your taste buds before the main course.\xa0', "The Sri Lankan Prawn Curry (Rs. 1400)\xa0was such a delight. The prawns were chewy, adequately spiced and well cooked. While the gravy wasn't overwhelmingly creamy, it had the proper balance of milkiness and spiciness, which satiates both Sri Lankan and Western palates.\xa0", 'It came with a side of sticky rice, veggies cooked in coconut milk, mango chutney, and some good old ', '. \xa0', 'Packed with herbs\xa0and flavor, the Lamb Kofta (Rs. 2100) at The Bungalow is a must try.\xa0It had three minced Australian lamb skewers that were properly blended with\xa0Middle Eastern spices, soaked in tomato onion chutney, and grilled to perfection. The meat itself was soft, moist and easy to bite into.\xa0', 'The Buttered rice on the side\xa0was sticky and had the ideal amount of seasoning with some caramelized onions, and ', '. It smelled and tasted so good;\xa0I would have just eaten that on its own.\xa0', "The Lentil Soup, however, didn't impress us. It was a tad watery for my taste, and the veggies were very mushy and overcooked.\xa0", "As for the dessert, we ordered up\xa0a Pavlova (Rs. 600). It's basically a massive meringue, covered in whipped cream and homemade blueberry glaze that thoroughly\xa0amazed us from its very first bite. There's a nice mellow surprise inside the shell of this\xa0giant meringue, which made us feel like eating a sugar-coated cloud, no regrets.\xa0", 'The whipped cream was\xa0good as the one we had at ', '; with perfect consistency and not too sweet. Their blueberry glaze was on point. It was made from fresh blueberries, that burst with flavor\xa0through every bite while balancing out the sweet and soul elements perfectly.\xa0', "Frothy, light\xa0and not burnt, the\xa0Latte (Rs. 500) had a good blend of coffee and caramel. The caramel flavor was strong but\xa0didn't overpower the coffee taste. Even the milk to coffee ratio was really good.\xa0It's a good pick-me up on a gloomy weather.\xa0", 'Walking through the doors of this place was like traveling back in time.\xa0Built during the Dutch colonial period,\xa0and\xa0extensively\xa0fortified throughout the British empire,\xa0it carries\xa0the remarks of both Dutch and British interior designs.', "The walls of the right wing are made with corals representing the Dutch architectural patterns, while the left one has brick walls that symbolize\xa0the British interior designs. They've got a simple, but nice courtyard at the back, which adds a homey vibe to it.\xa0", 'The waitstaff at The Bungalow is well trained. They were more than happy to assist us to choose the best food that went with our appetite.\xa0With genuine friendliness and smiles all around, they made us feel very welcome. Our waiter was polite,\xa0attentive\xa0and hovered at a discrete distance and slid right over whenever we needed something.\xa0', "The Bungalow - Galle Fort is an ideal place for a couples getaway, or to spend a\xa0 relaxing day or two while backpacking through down south, and even to grab a delicious meal whenever you're\xa0in Galle. The alluring seashore of Galle is literally a 5-minute walk\xa0from here, and there're a bunch of other historical monuments, shops, and restaurants around, that awaits for the explorer in you.\xa0", 'All in all, we had a very pleasant experience at this gorgeous colonial boutique hotel.\xa0It is so peaceful out there, and you simply cannot get enough of its comfiness and delicious food.', "So, if you're keen on having a relaxing escape\xa0at the\xa0paradisaical down south, away from all the chatter and noise, while enjoying a homelike stay in an exquisite, historic bungalow, this is just the place to be.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Built on the ruins of an elegant family house, The Bungalow - Galle Fort is an exquisite colonial structure dating back to the 1700s.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ගෙදර වගේ රිලැක්ස් වෙන්න නියම තැනක්!\n                                                                                                                            ']
