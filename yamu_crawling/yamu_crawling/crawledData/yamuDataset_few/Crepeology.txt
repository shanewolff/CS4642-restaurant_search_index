address: 53 Leyn Baan Street, Galle Fort 
directions: If you're driving best to park near the Lighthouse, along the ramparts (you can take the road along the south side of the Fort and through the Dutch Hospital). Walk up the street past the mosque (Leyn Baan) and it's just after the first junction. In the evenings you go upstairs.
