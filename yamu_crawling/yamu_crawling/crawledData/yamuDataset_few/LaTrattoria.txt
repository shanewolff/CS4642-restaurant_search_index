It's about the most authentic italian you would find in Colombo. It's expensive because you pay for good ingredients. Those expecting Sri Lankan Italian should stay away.

Like some have stated, there are plenty of Italian restaurants or restaurants serving Italian food in the heart of Colombo that charge far less for the same quality and ambience….I don't understand how the owners of this establishment can justify such astronomical prices for what essentially is a restaurant far out in the suburbs that serve the same sort of food….\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I thought "il gelato" sells gelato. Why is the word ice cream mentioned all the time ? Gelato is not Italian word for ice cream or whatever. This only emphasises the point (mentioned by many readers) that most locals do not know to appreciate or differentiate authentic Italian cuisine. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    This restaurant has everything set up for success but …. We walked in at lunch with 3 guests. We (4pax) were pointed to a table and left twiddling our thumbs. No menu (would only take a few seconds) was given so we walked out after waiting for a while. Would have loved to try out the food but the poor service was a bummer.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    We made a reservation on the 5th of October to this restaurant 's Colombo branch ( park street mews)  for the 10th of October. We reconfirmed that reservation to let them know we were getting late. Once we get there the lady in change was compleaty disinterested and informed us that there was no such reservation and unapologetically sent us out. I was embarrassed since I had invited people for dinner and the lady incharge was so off hand with us especially when it was a mistake on their end. This  is unacceptable! So guess I will never be patronizing this establishment ever againand.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Nice ambiance and good food.', '\nAlthough the female owner was very loud and was ordering the staff around in a very unpleasant tone.', '\nApart from that the pork chops and mash potatoes were great. Smoked salmon antipasti had too much greenery!!!!\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I never comment on yamu but I had such a bad experience here that I have to warn others. I went there the other day with 3 friends and as nice as ambiance was I will never ever go back. We were there for 2.5 hours, it took 20 minutes to get the menu and wine list. the manager didn't seem to know anything about the wines she was serving and half the list wasn't available. They served stale burnt bread that they were trying to claim was bruchetta (it wasn't) and we had to ask to get some olive oil or balsamic vinegar to dip it in. We ordered 1 spaghetti wongoli, 1 cheese platter, 1 cold cut platter and 3 Parma ham pizzas. We also asked for 4 glasses of wine (and later a bottle of wine) and 4 glasses of water- 2.5 hours later only 1 pasta, the wine, the cold cut platter, 2 glasses of water and 1 pizza had arrived. The pizza was greasy and burnt and the pasta had no seasoning and they didn't even offer parmesan. The staff were totally untrained- no-one seemed responsible for any area and the manager was rushed off her feet but didn't seem to get anything done. The table next to us took over an hour to be cleaned after the last guest left. The waiter offered to give us 2 glasses of wine on the house and only charge for the bottle of wine we had, but couldn't seem to understand that if he was still charging for the bottle of wine that we had watched him pour our first glasses out of then the glasses of wine weren't on the house at all as we were still paying for them! Even with not paying for the  half of our food that hadn't arrived  our bill still came to 16,500 RS. A total joke tbh, and such a shame because the decor and atmosphere is really nice, and it was a treat to have real imported Parma ham again, but honestly Colombo has far better authentic Italian restaurants with far better service and for half the price! Avoid of you can! \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Keep on driving…whatever you do don't go out of your way to dine here.  Only stop in if you have to en route back to the city. Food was bland and limp.  Its hard to undercook penne but they did. Service was fair to midland and at times quite confusing.  Its a shame as the location and setting is quite beautiful and full of potential.  Someone please rescue this place. \n                                            "]
