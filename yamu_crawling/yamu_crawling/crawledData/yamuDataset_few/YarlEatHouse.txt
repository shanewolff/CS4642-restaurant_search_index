Hot pittu and crab curry is a must. They do some nice omlet as well. Savan I was told that you can get crab curry made to order (with Murugaa and other variants) for take away.  I have the phone no. 011 259 3905. You can call and order in advance and I believe they are open till 10 pm.

My girl was born in Sri Lanka but raised in Aussie and is a foodie of sorts with her own range of gourmet mustards and chutneys. She'd heard from another friend (UK based) that this place is to die for and she insisted we pick up some crab when we visited last March.  I'd put it off for lack of time but eventually gave in and rushed there the night before we left Colombo. On the way, the gods seems to be speaking to us when the rain came down in sheets and the tuk-tuk broke down in bumper to bumper traffic.  Unfazed we soldiered on and got heaps of crab, cuttle fish and shark take-away with a few g'roti and a mix of pittu and main-pittu.  Loot in hand, we rushed home to a shower and a Lion Larger that set us up for Neptune's feast!

So had to satisfy ourselves with Cuttlefish Koththu, Pittu and Parata. And didn't we hammer away, the Koththu had so much of Cuttlefish couldn't separate the Koththu and the Cuttlefish. Omelet was good as always. 1700/= for four people who can eat really really well.
