excerpt: BreadTalk. We've been there a few times. And on every visit I'm strangely drawn to the polished, round buns, the cheesy breads, the flaky danishes - and each time, I come away disappointed - like a sad, slightly singed moth.

Seriously if I wanted to dig into a local favorite such as a maalu paan, I won’t be heading in their direction. Instead I will bypass BreadTalk (Lipton Circus) and head to Bake House! Bake House fits well into our bath kade dominated city and if I wanted a “petti kade on wheels”, I’m sure I can find one down Deans Road. Malk you are spot on! I love their pork items and the porkie pocket is my favorite which is just absolutely delightful. Their latest roll-out is the chicken Chinese roll which in my opinion is divine!

I see a lot of hater comments they post  as u sed and  yes they seem to diss every rich business and business men. Its probably got to do with Jealously and envy of other business people who do well and they try to do what it takes to put these folks down. anyway yamu please get a life and stop being biased. your views do not represent rest of SL.

Their open kitchen concept only proves that they are hygienic and truly care about their customers. The next time you visit Fab or any other local bakery in Colombo, ask to be taken into their kitchen and service areas! I am sure that your request will be declined and all for good reason. I would prefer to pay a little extra knowing that I am getting good food. Only my opinion. As customers, we need to demand for better quality. It is our right! Even the "petti kade" on wheels will have to make their box clean and presentable. A fresh coat of paint maybe? If we as a society demand for clean food, these local bakeries will have to tweak up their places of business and give us just that! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I've only been to the Park Road joint, and like some of their stuff, and pick it up quite regularly.

However, I think the Sri Lankan version is disappointing for some reason for the price. I personally think one can say that something is "not worth the money" if something equivalent in taste and quality can be had for a similar amount of money elsewhere. It\'s true that the posh joint and big parking space for those "peace of mind" crowd drives the prices up. But after all it\'s not a fancy restaurant (at least in Singapore). Personally, i used to go to a bread talk just to grab some pastry, and that\'s what I expect here too. In that sense, I can identify with the author of this article. Food doesn\'t have to taste the same for everyone. But generally, I also find that their food doesn\'t have that "thing" in it for the price. It\'s pretty soul-less, even compared to a pastry at Fab.', '\r\n', '\r\nIf I were as elitist as some here, I would even have said that a pastry retail chain in developed countries has become an elite identity icon in undeveloped Sri Lanka.', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Constructive criticism is a rare delicacy in Sri Lanka where most reviews are sugar loaves, or worse, just verbatim press releases dished out by the vendor.  Shru’s criticisms are a new flavour in the journalistic menu, and of course some people find it distasteful. But likes and dislikes of food, and thereby the perceived ‘value for money’, is a somewhat subjective matter.  I personally often take a tuna sandwich from Breadtalk on Park Road. No complaints on the quality. But price? Well, I find that the sandwiches and even the lowly ‘maalu paan’ at the Coffee Stop at Cinnamon Grand to be tastier and better value for money, BUT, who wants to jump the hoops of valet parking just to pick up a sandwich? Parking at Breadtalk is no problem at all. Cost @ Rs 280 per sandwich does add up to Rs 7,000 per month. And Rs 280 = $2.25 and that’s what I pay for a sandwich in Vancouver where the tuna filling is probably imported from Sri Lanka and the labour cost is $10 per hour. Something is amiss here in the price structure. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    HsienLoong: I think it was Warren Buffet who said "Price is what you pay.

As it is a franchise I am sure that they have to follow certain guidelines and this might be the importation of certain raw materials. I do know this because I asked them why their dough tasted sweet and they informed me that the dough used is a pre-mix imported from Singapore. Apparently all the BreadTalk outlets around the world have no choice but to import their dough mix. With importation of raw materials comes added costs, delivery, duties etc. so I don’t think that they can do anything more where price is concerned.

I guess in a country like Singapore space is expensive and it is a luxury which cannot be provided. ', '\r\n', '\r\nThis review in my opinion is alright. Everyone has a different opinion when it comes to taste, price etc. but all in all I think that BreadTalk is not all that bad. I just find the dough a little too sweet. Maybe we are just not ready for international food chains to establish themselves in our country. We should tell them to go away and come back in 20 years.', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Like I said once before… පාන් කියාගන්න බැරි අපිට මොන BreadTalk ද?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Breadtalk obviously has a lot more stuff to eat than Paan paan, and despite what anybody says i will tell you that compared to what we earn in Sri Lanka, any kind of food is expensive when compare to other countries. People in Vancouver can afford to pay 2 or 3 US$ for a sandwich !!! and 300 rs. for the same thing in SL in simply not worth it.
