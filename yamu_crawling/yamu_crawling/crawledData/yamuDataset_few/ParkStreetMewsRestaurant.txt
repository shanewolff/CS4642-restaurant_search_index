yamu_review: ["Park Street Mews Restaurant is one of those select few that have managed to\nremain relevant and maintain high standards throughout the past few years. They\nhaven't changed much at all, but we're fine with that since the food is\nexcellent, the service is fast and the unorthodox setting is still quite\nchic.", "Many things need to come into play for a restaurant to be a continued\nsuccess, but the most important of all is consistency, and few have been as\nconsistent as the Park Street Mews Restaurant. What we love is the fact that\nthey haven't had to make a ton of changes stay in the game.", "That being said they have introduced some popular value meals like their\nthree-course executive lunch for Rs. 1200. This seems to be what everyone goes\nfor during lunch and while the portions aren't quite as large, it's still a\nkiller offer. For their regular stuff the prices are on the higher side, though\nthe portions are still very generous, so expect to pay around Rs. 2000 per\nhead.", "From their starters we picked the baked crab gratinated with parmesan (Rs.\n825), which is honestly filling enough to be considered a main, but hey, it was\ndelicious so it's definitely not a complaint. It's accompanied by a fresh mixed\nsalad which is welcomed contrast from the creamy richness of the baked crab.\nWe've found that restaurants tend to cut corners when it comes to dishes with\ncrab meat but that was definitely not the case here. The layer of gratinated\nparmesan also added nice differentiation from the smooth texture of that crab\nmeat.", 'For our main we went with the slow cooked pork in soy and aniseed (Rs.\n1650), served with mashed potatoes on bed of sauteed okra. This one was also on\npoint in terms of flavours and nearly perfect in terms of texture as well. The\npork which was prepared as a roulade was cooked beautifully for the most part\nbut we did find the center to be just slightly chewy, but this is me being very\npicky. Another thing we appreciated was the fact that we could actually taste\nthat soy as oppose to it just being a line in the description.', "To wrap up we tried the white chocolate and yoghurt soup with strawberry\nsorbet (Rs. 525). Don't be too confused about the yoghurt soup part, since it's\npretty much just melted yoghurt. That being said, it does marry very well with\nthe fresh strawberry sorbet and strawberry slices. The only real complain with\nthis one was the fact that the white chocolate flavour didn't really register\non our palate.", "The ambience at PSM has remained all but unchanged, but it's still one of\nthe better looking and unique restaurants in the area. They manage to strike a\nbalance between rustic and modern in terms of interior decor, with lighter\ncolour palates of grey, green and off-white. At the back they've also got a\nsome comfy looking couches for those looking to grab a drink and\nchill.", 'Last week when we dropped in at ', ", which is next door and run by the same management,\nwe weren't very happy with the service. This time around, however, they were\nback on track with well paced service and attentive waiters, who were always on\nthe floor.", "Park Street Mews restaurant is one of the few that we can keep recommending\nbecause we know that they consistently serve excellent food. With budget\nfriendly additions like the executive lunch deal, we think they're moving in\nthe right direction.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Park Street Mews Restaurant is one of those select few that have managed to remain relevant and maintain high standards throughout the years.

I have actually been following several of Yamu's reviews and testing the places out for myself and can honestly say that some of your reviews could not be further from the truth.

The basic unanimous opinion is that the food is not worth the price.  As you say they do offer "decent food". Decent food must be decently priced also.
