excerpt: We’re not huge fans of the French macaron, but they looked so pretty that we gave Munchkin a call and ordered ourselves a box of 10, which included an assortment of vanilla, chocolate and pistachio flavours.

Also the oreo cupcakes, and the strawberry cheesecakes ones and the double chocolate… ok I am going to stop now or I am never going to be able to concentrate on anything other than eating one more of those cup cakes\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I dont know about all the places that are mentioned here :P but Im a ardent fan of MUNCHKIN and I loveeeeeeeeeee the macaroons that they have! Since im not a Hugh choco fan, I  like the vanilla ones better! they are so tender and just blissfully melts in your mouth :)) sigh!!! pure sweet heaven … I would also like to recommend their Ribbon cakes!! you dont know what your missing till you try it :) :)\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Odel has just started selling macarons too.
