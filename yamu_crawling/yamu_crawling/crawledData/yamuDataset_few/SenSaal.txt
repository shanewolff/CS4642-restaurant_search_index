name: Sen Saal
excerpt: Sen Saal is another one of Colombo's quick eat places. LikeFab, they serve short eats, cakes, dessert and lamprais. Sen Saal is also a good example of the Sri Lankan love of making things more difficult than they need to be - ordering and paying is a complicated, painful process here.

Do i went and asked but No one was bothered. I told them i need a new juice since the cool has gone. And they were still like okay but not bothered. I waited for 20 min. But yet i ddnt get my juice. And then i  raised my voice scolding the lady  and she was like you ddnt tell me. I got really pissed. Then i requested  log book to write a complain and then they soon started to prepare a new juice.  Really unsatisfyinh.
