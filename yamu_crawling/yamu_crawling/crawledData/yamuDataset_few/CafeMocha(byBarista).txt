name: Cafe Mocha (by Barista)
excerpt: Your regular Barista in a beautiful building.
yamu_review: ["Cafe Mocha's in one of the further ends of Colombo, but is a beautiful place. Preserving its original architechture and woodwork, Mocha has great ambience. Food is sadly a different story, but hey, they've got amazing sofas to curl up and read a good book. That's what most cafes are for, right?", "Service is meh meh, nothing notably great. The staff aren't unfriendly, but polite. Food options are displayed on a blackboard near the counter, in addition to the menus laid out as well. Place your order and grab a comfortable seat — you've got plenty to choose from but more on that later.", 'Food-wise, ayyo it was disappointing! Value for money is an unknown concept here, and worse is that the food is just mediocre.', 'Our Blueberry Cheesecake (Rs. 420) had a gelatinously set and thin layer of blueberry glaze, while the cheesecake was dense and not in the least cheese-cakey. Worst was the base, which was an intensely soggy biscuit base. Soggy!\xa0', "The pol-sambol, egg, and cheese sandwhich was alright. The flavours balanced out okay, and the tanginess of the sambol made it through the other components, but the bread was over-toasted and tasted a bit bitter. The sandwich's accompanying fries were well prepped, and for that I'm grateful.", 'We also tried the Grilled Moroccan Chicken Salad (Rs. 680) which was actually quite good. The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned, though a teensy bit too tough, and it was tossed in a generous bowl of greens. More importantly, there was a nice chunk of meat as opposed to the few pieces of chicken which most places just toss into a salad.', "Drinks-wise, their cappuccino (Rs. 410) was pretty average which is to say that it wasn't too intense or bitter but not really remarkable either. Their Crunchy Cookie Shake (Rs. 680) is overpriced, but still enjoyable. It's a really nice regular milkshake, with loads of whipped cream and chunks of cookies scattered in it. We picked the cookies out and ate them dipped in cream, and that was quite, quite nice. Barista's cookies are quite satisfying, at least served like this.", "The vibe here is the best thing about it. Quiet, low-key, plenty of space with comfortable seating, it's wonderful to get some work done or to spend some quiet time with a book or an old friend. There are interesting prints hung up all about the place, and there's a dark wood theme going on, from furniture to doors, windows and the like. The settees are enormous and comfortable, and if you're tiny you'll most likely get lost in them. Plus, they've also got three floors, with the third rather unused. It also looks a bit like a gaming room.", "Lovely ambience, but unremarkable food. I'd recommend going here if you want to get some work done in a chilled-out, spacious, and comfortable place, but not for the food. It's probably more for undergraduates and students though, because we saw a bunch of them sitting around and studying.", '\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Great atmosphere, dull food.\n\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    වාතාවරණය පැත්තෙන් ගත්තොත්, කැෆේ මෝකා එක මරු. ඉඩකඩ ඇතිව අතපය දිගෑරලා සැප පහසුවට ඉන්න පුළුවන්. ලසඤ්ඤා එක ගැන හිත අමාරු කරගත්තට, අනිත් කෑමවල වරදක් අපට දකින්න ලැබුණේ නැහැ. \n                                                                                                                            ']

I once ordered a "cold cheesecake" which was super gelatinous and gross. Since I don\'t learn from my mistakes a few weeks back I ordered a chocolate coffee torte type thing which was again glutey and stretchy and just really disgusting. They both cost me Rs 500+ each. Barista, you guys really need to stop ripping your customers off like this. It\'s not on. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Since of late the service is terrible. The waiters are really rude. I overheard this waiter telling a girl who had come with a friend, who was a boy(I assumed they were friends cause they were just sitting and talking innocently) that 'couples' can't sit together on a sofa cause its misbehaving! For starters, it was wrong of him to even assume they were a couple. I heard from a lot of other people as well that they make rude comments everytime a boy and girl hangs out there. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    This place the ambiance the music and the staff are just superb…', '\nThe staff are relaxed and enjoying what they do very interactive and most of all look happy……', '\nMust say the food is not excellent but hope they improve on their short menu selection and desserts….', '\nDefinitely a cool place to hangout to catch up with a friend\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Cafe mocha by barista is a great place for working. I like the service and the food. The smoked chicken sandwich is my favourite. The coffees are pretty sick. Iv been coming here for the past 4 years. they have live music playing on weekends. Other kool thing is the loyalty customer programme they have. im able to get free meals and teas. Over all an awsome place to work from. I bring all my clients and often have meetings in their upstairs meeting rooms. Highly recommended place for small businesses operating from home and families.   \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Dave ', '\r\nCafe mocha is a great place to hangout with friends and to chill the day with a sandwich and a cup of coffee. This was the 4th time i have visited this outlet and every time I been there the services was great, the food was crispy & fresh and also the beverages have been fresh and good value for the money I spend. customer service was top quality and the Customs relation manager was very friendly and well mannered. Therefore, I will not hesitate to introduce any of my friends or colleagues to Cafe Mocha by Barista as the environment, services & location serves the best value to your meal & great place to chill with your friends with a nice cup of coffee \n                                            ']
