name: Banana Leaf
excerpt: They do chicken biryani pretty darn good and now have crab and lamb on the menu.
yamu_review: ["New Banana Leaf is a restaurant that specializes in a localized Chinese Biriyani that's pretty solid. The moment you enter the place, you get the smell of their tandoori chicken that just won't let you be. We resisted the temptation and tried their new offerings of crab and lamb for dinner.", 'You can order biriyani, be it chicken, lamb, mutton or crab, or just get your biryani rice on its own. We went that route, and it only cost Rs 120 for a single portion of biriyani rice and it was plenty. For curries, we ordered crab (Rs 350), mutton (Rs 450) and lamb (Rs 500). They also gave us an onion sambol and masi sambol at Rs 80 each. The biriyani rice itself was good, though they use a small samba grain as opposed to basmati. The rice is super soft and light, which is great.', 'First off, the lamb was pretty good. We got just two pieces for Rs 500, but they were quite flavourful and cooked till they were soft. The curry came with caramelized onions that lent a lovely sweetness to the dish.', "The mutton wasn't spectacular. The gravy was your typical salty, heavy on pepper affair. It didn't really help the fatty taste of the mutton come through, and the mutton itself was still a bit tough. We got two big chunks, though, so you get more meat than with the lamb.", "For Rs 350, we got a whole crab in a wonderful crab curry. It was a proper Sri Lankan crab curry, not too spicy but plenty flavourful. It's not a big crab, by any means, about the same size as what you'd get at Yarl. Worth it.", "We're not big on the garish green colour that surrounds you in this place. Service is pretty prompt. They get you a cold, wet towel as you take your seat, and set out your banana leaf before the food gets to the table.\xa0", "If you're in Colpetty and want an affordable biriyani, New Banana Leaf is a good option. They close at 9.30PM \xa0though, so they're not a great dinner option unless you're getting take out. Check them out for lunch\xa0sometime.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Good biriyani with crab and lamb options.
