yamu_review: ["It was Rishani's birthday\xa0and she brought us a box full of the most delicious brownies we've ever had. Imaad told me we had brownie cake, and brownie cake it was.", "Mere words cannot describe how good it was. Our connoisseur Malinthe, who's very hard to please, went for thirds, fourths, and fifths.", 'Very thick and generous pieces, the brownies were not overly sweet and struck a perfect balance in terms of texture, chocolatey flavour, and nice, very light and thin\xa0crust. The base was decadent and moist, and we loved the dark chocolate flavour that just oozed out. At Rs. 110 a brownie, we thought it was well worth it.', "We'd ideally order in and review a minimum of three items unless we're talking about a specific meal, but this was so good that we decided to do a post on it.", 'Shoutout to ', " for one of the best brownies YAMU's had!", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Amazing brownies.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Ru's Kitchen එකේ හැදෙන චොක්ලට් බ්\u200dරව්නීස්වල හොඳ තද චොක්ලට් රසක් තියෙන බව නම් කියන්නම ඕනේ. ඕනෑවට වඩා පැණි රහක් එන්නේ නැති නිසා, පැණි රසට එච්චර කැමති නැති කෙනෙක්ට වුණත් කිසිම අවුලක් නැතුව මේ චොක්ලට් බ්\u200dරව්නීස් රස විඳින්න පුළුවන්.\n                                                                                                                            "]
