excerpt: Quick Thai serves up pretty good, filling Thai dishes at affordable prices. 
yamu_review: ["Quick Thai is a reliable place for consistently good food. The prices aren't cheap, but portions are more than enough for two people and the food barely ever disappoints.", 'Perched on\xa0Maitland Crescent and overshadowed by the lush trees that blessedly line that road, Quick Thai has\xa0a basic dining area with wooden desks and benches for seating and plenty of natural lighting. The decor\xa0is simple, clean, and well-maintained.', "We've been there a couple of times and both times had just one server running around. Tha's a\xa0bit short of staff for when the house is full, but they're quite efficient and do a good job.\xa0", "Apparently, the Executive Lunch pack serves one, where as their regular meals are enough for two. Pro tip though, they're nearly both the same price, so you get better value for money by just picking the regular option. We started off with a Spicy and Sour Chicken Soup (Rs. 650) which was misleading in appearance — pale, swimming in boiled veggies and chicken, this looked as un-spicy as it could get. ", ' it packed a punch of flavour and heat, had quite a bit of chillie swimming quietly around, and had a great lemongrass\xa0kick to it as well.', "I went for a Beef Pad Thai with Dark Soy Sauce (Rs. 600) which was quite satisfactory. It was the exec lunch pack, but was still a lot for one person (or maybe because this was because I'd souped up earlier).\xa0 The noodles were well done and full of flavour, the strips of beef also immensely flavoursome,\xa0but more like jerky and less juicy, chunky strips.", "Our other dish was a Chicken Fried Rice (Rs. 680). Yes, rather pricey for fried rice, but again it's enough for two to three people to be honest. The rice was moist and sticky, it had adequate amounts of chicken in it. Nothing much to write home about though.", 'Their juice options are interesting, and very very strong. We tried the Lime and Sprite (Rs. 370) and the fresh Tamarind Juice (Rs. 395), both which could knock you out with their flavour.', "The Lime and Sprite had plenty of acidic lime to it and I liked it, though my friend found it too strong for his liking. My tamarind juice was superbly done in the sense that it wasn't overpoweringly sour, and had some ", ' treacle sweetness in it too. However it was way too strong for me to finish so yeah, that went nearly untouched.', "Good food, friendly service, and a nice location. Maybe don't get adventurous with the drinks, and just stick to the food.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Quick Thai's a reliable place for consistently good food. \n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Quick Thai serves up quality Thai dishes at surprisingly decent prices.

I either visit one of the restaurant or order take away at least once a week. However, recently I have noticed the quality of some of  the curries have dropped. The last two times I ordered the red curry chicken (Once from Colo 7 outlet and last evening from the Thalawathugoda outlet) I found the taste is not the same - it used to be spicy but now it's very mild. I also noticed that the amount of chicken has reduced, instead there's  lots of vegetables (beans etc.,) in the curry.  I hope this will be rectified and the quality and taste of the food will be maintained, as Quick Thai is my favorite spicy food outlet in Colombo and I want to keep enjoying their delicious curries!!  \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    This curry has no chicken…I was appalled to see my guests fishing for small.morsels of meat !!! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Hey Ken, look on the right side of the page, we haven't removed the star ratings. :) \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    @YAMU team, Ken does have a point, though.

', '\nTo spare you the whole story: I can recommend this restaurant. You can stop reading now. Because what follows, is a description of my satisfaction. And I am not easily pleased. The food may be good, if the waiters are crap, I don’t come back. Well, the Quick Thai guys understood my English and I theirs. They’re fast, pretty efficient and they can make a bill that is correct. They got me even baffled when they asked “Is it okay if we prepare your main course now?” There’s a line you don’t hear often in Colombo! Hospitality can be that simple.', '\nThe food was tasty, much and affordable. We had 1 portion of eggrolls, 2 (delicious) soups, 2 (powerful) curries - rice included (!), a mango salad and 2 bottles of natural fire extinguisher. And we were full! We walked away for 4000 Rs, exactly the budget we, 2 hungry dudes, had in mind. ', '\nFlaws? I couldn’t find them, so I have to come again. Compliments for the simple but clean interior – and exterior, because we sat outside. Toilets were clean too, my buddy told me. Actually, the only thing I didn’t like were the rich daddies dropping their daughters of for dinner while letting the diesel engine run shamelessly in front of our table. A ‘sorry’ doesn’t cut it, daddy-o! We were inhaling your gasses! Engine off or park on the left side and cross the street! ', '\nOne warning. Were I come from, Thai restaurants indicate with 1, 2 or 3 chili peppers the spiciness of menu items. Maybe they don’t in Sri Lanka, but trust me, when the Quick Thai menu explicitly mentions that a soup is hot, it really is, complete with a burning sensation the next morning. Trust me.

I placed a large order recently including 3 portions of the Thai red curry Chicken. I  received a good dose of curry, but very little chicken ! I was aghast to see my guests 'fishing' for tiny morsels of chicken. The same was the case with Basil prawn, again a few prawns in a vegetable mess.

My yesterdays order for dinner bill amounting to Rs 6,600/- was absolute waste of money. More than the shit quality the quantity of food was shocking. For example the hot butter cuttle fish for Rs 700 consists of a portion not more than a regular yoghurt cup. it is very much better less said and time wasted in this quick Thai place, I will never ever recommend this place to any one nor shall order any more. This was called and very clearly mentioned to the person who was took the order (Prakash) who apologized profusely and agreed about the quantity as well and said Yes sir I even told the chef regarding same. That was the solution offered.

So grabbed eight of my friends (3 of whom who've had food here more than 4 times) and visited for a pre-holiday lunch.", '\nWell, I cannot find if anything has changed - it certainly has got familiar and not a novelty to have hot, delish Thai food at non 5-star prices anymore … and if I was pressed I would say the food was not piping hot when it arrived at our table (maybe due to them waiting for all 10 odd dishes were done), but the quality, size, taste and price of the food remained the same.', '\n', '\nAm I missing something here?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Was there for lunch today and really enjoyed it.

And since coming back to sri lanka we have been trying to find a good thai food restaurent we were dissapointed when we tried what was on offer.

Best part was the bill meant it was only 1300 per person and there were food enough for another person remaining on the table. Service was also very friendly.

The food, for starters, was nothing to write home about. Passable to say the most, I might rate it a 5/10. Constant power cuts meant the A/C kept going off(which I am totally ok with, as it is not within the control of the restaurant), but the real turn off was not being able to order 'anything'(no, not even ice or water), while the power was out, due to their computers not being on!(the restaurant clearly could do something to negate this problem! like billing on paper or keeping track of the order for entering on the computer when power resumes). The price was quite reasonable, thats the only thing thats good about this place. What the real turn off was the attitude of the people there. The staff was OK, again passable, but the so called manager named Neil was so brash and discourteous, it looked as if he didn't care whether the customers stayed at the place or not! He would not listen to ANY rhyme or reason, and was so rude to the customers, its a good thing that he didn't own a restaurant.
