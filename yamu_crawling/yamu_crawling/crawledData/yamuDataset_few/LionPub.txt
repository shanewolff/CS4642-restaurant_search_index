name: Lion Pub
excerpt: The Lion Pub has the best entrance of any bar in Colombo and really cheap beer and good food in large portions
yamu_review: ["The Lion Pub is one of a Mount Lavinia's oldest food establishments, and\n has since become somewhat of a landmark. It may not be as popular as it\n was back in the day, but the food is surprisingly good, the portions \nare generous and the atmosphere is perfect for a cool Lion lager.", "The\n Lion Pub serves up some happiness inducing Sri Lankan Chinese fare. The\n prices are also incredibly cheap for the massive portions they serve \nup. We'd suggest going with a group of around four because even the \nsmall portions are way too much for two. You can easily manage for \naround Rs. 700 per head with beer. The food is mostly Sri Lankan \nChinese, but this is actually one of the few oldies that still does it \nreally well. ", "You can't go a to a place named the Lion Pub \nand not have a Lion lager (Rs. 250). They've got a pretty comprehensive beverage menu, all of it priced as low as you'll probably \nfind. ", "For rice, we went with their simplest option- the \negg and onion fried rice (Rs. 570 for S). We actually really liked this \none since it didn't have too many veges, instead you get a good amount \nof onion for added texture. The rice isn't basmati but still worked very\n well with the rest of the dishes we ordered.", "The double fried \npork (Rs. 570 for S) was a solid iteration of the classic devilled pork.\n I'm a huge fan of fatty pork, so this one was right up my alley. The \ngood thing, however, is the fact that there was a great balance of heat,\n pepper and seasoning though it does come with quite a lot of onions and\n green chillies.", "The hot butter cuttlefish (Rs. 590 for S) was\n also decent but not one of the best we've had. The cuttlefish was \nactually cooked fine, but the batter was just a bit too thick. That \nbeing said, it works well as a bite to have along with a beer. ", 'The\n best dish we tried though, was the Singapore chilli crab (560 for S). \nWe looked at the price and assumed it would be a small portion, but what\n we got was easily enough for four and then some. It also tasted really \ngreat with just the right amount of sweetness and chilli in the almost \nglaze like sauce, with the crab being cooked to the point where you \ncould crush the shell and easily get all the meat.', "As\n far as iconic entrances go, you'd be hard-pressed to find one that can \nrival that of the Lion Pub with their lion head.\xa0 The interior\n is very simple with wooden furniture and white walls. They've also got \nan outdoor seating area under the shade of a very large bamboo tree. ", "\nYou'll likely find a few old gents having a few cold ones and catching \nup on some cricket.", 'Service at the Lion Pub \nwas actually ridiculously fast. The waiters have this really nonchalant \nattitude but their actually very efficient.', "The Lion Pub is a classic, and a good one at that. If you're looking for a place to meet up with some friends, grab some beers and bites to eat, the Lion Pub fits the bill perfectly.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Lion Pub is one of a Mount Lavinia's oldest food establishments, and has since become somewhat of a landmark.
