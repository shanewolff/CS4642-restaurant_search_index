name: The Sugar Shack
excerpt: We were recently introduced to the Sugar Shack, run by Aru De Silva. From the looks of Facebook she seems to be one of the younger players emerging on our rapidly growing network of home bakeries. Her menu isn't extensive - no french macarons, meringues or fancy desserts - but she offers a large variety of cupcakes, cakes, brownies and cheesecake.
