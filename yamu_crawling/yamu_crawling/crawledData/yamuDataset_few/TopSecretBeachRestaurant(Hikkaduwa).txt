yamu_review: ["Top Secret Beach Restaurant is an awesome little hangout by the beach in Hikka. The ambience is great and the food was\xa0actually quite good, without being too pricey as Hikkaduwa rates tend to be. It's also top secret so cue ", '\xa0on your iPod when you walk in.', 'We got plates of prawn rice, tomato and cheese spaghetti, and rice with devilled fish.', 'The portions were decent, we were full at the end of it, and we enjoyed the food - especially the creamy\xa0spaghetti and the spicy fish tossed with capsicums.', "We also got Top Secret butterscotch ice cream, which sounded\xa0super special and made me feel like a spy - it tasted alright, nothing mind blowing. Surprisingly our visit didn't\xa0cost as much as we though it would\xa0- there were three of us and each spent only about Rs. 850.", "Service was prompt. It's the ambience that really won us over. There are seats right by the beach in typical beach-restaurant fashion - but the seats more interior are the best. There's a wooden structure in the sand here, under which you get plenty of\xa0colourful cushions\xa0and\xa0paduru mats, and it's quite cosy and pleasant if you're hanging\xa0with a bunch of friends.", "There are boats and randoms around you so\xa0it's a quirky, quiet set-up in the middle of a beach.", "Top Secret is one of the good places to relax at if you're in Hikkaduwa. It's easily accessible on the main road, the food is good and mostly the atmosphere is very chill and creative."]
