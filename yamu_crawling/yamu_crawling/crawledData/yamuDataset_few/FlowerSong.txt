I too always considered it to be the best place to have eat in Kandy.  ', "\r\nIf you're doomed to visit Kandy, be sure to eat at Flower Song.  \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    yeah there arent enough places to dine in kandy(and theres no nightlife)…I'd call kandy the bakers town,because every street has a bakery(devon,p&s,rathnayaka bakers,benthota bakers,delight bakers,bake house)…I feel kandy people eat a lot of bread…The town is filled with bakery … visit kandy eat bread or pastrys\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    I LOVE KANDY!!! \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Hi,', '\nJust to clarify this article is outdated, last year Flower Song moved to No. 281 D.S Senanayake Veediya which is a 10 minute walk. A much better place which is spacious and totally worth a visit when in kandy, the food and service is as good as it was…  TheYamu team should check it out! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I just moved here last year and being from Colombo and used to a hectic, busy & social life I can understand one's boredom and non existent life here in Kandy. Having said that, there are some great places to eat here. I'm not talking about the hotels or the bakeries … I'm talking about places you have to go and try out for yourself. I also believe the food here in Kandy is waaaaay better and tastier than in Colombo. Next time try out  Slightly Chilled/The Pub/Aroma Cafè/Royal Bar & Hotel … to name a few :) \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    The food was ok, they sure give you a lot of it. The buttered cuttlefish was nice.  The noodle dishes were to dry . It  is a  nice place and has working air conditioning. The service was very attentive. I believe the address listed here is wrong, so call first. I would go back. Another option in the area is the buffet at the Chayaa Citadel, it was tasty. Not sure what other food options there are in Kandy. We went to the botanical garden again. My wife loves it. This time we had a bad experiences with large groups of teenage schoolboys. It was a very uncomfortable experience being surrounded by a dozen boys staring at my wife's boobs and saying rude remarks. I bit my tongue but I was so turned off.  It creeps me out and I am a guy. I wonder what their mothers would think. Oh well.\n                                            "]
