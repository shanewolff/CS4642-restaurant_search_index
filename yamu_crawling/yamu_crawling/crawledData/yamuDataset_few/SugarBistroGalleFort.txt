user_reviews: ['\n                                            We arrived at the restaurant around 4pm and we were promptly told by the staff that they could only provide us with drinks. Were OK and we settled down for Coffee. Half an hour later, they served food to a couple of foreign girls sitting at the table next to us! When we questioned the waiter said it was someone known to the owner so they were an exception. We were extremely disappointed about the attitude shown and the so called no-food policy after lunch time. Would never go there again.\n                                    ']
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    Sugar Bristo can be a very nice place to be at, unless ( a big unless) you get welcomed by that pyscho waiter "Shreenath". I have no idea why they transferred him to the new establishment in Galle, and on the opening day as well !', '\r\n', '\r\nI think they will extend the menu once things get going. ', '\r\n', '\r\nTip - "Shreenath" uses different names at different establishment. Don\'t believe if he says a dish or drink is unavailable just ask another waiter. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    At Sugar Bistro,Galle for desserts, I decided to be adventurous and try out the ginger meringue mocha mousse ( maybe not in the same word order)with chocolate syrup……,,the mousse was decent, the Ginger was not and the chocolate syrup was used as a deco than a part of the dessert….but what annoyed me the most was the fact they expected me to eat it with a table spoon and when I asked for a dessert spoon the waiter ', '\n dumbfounded and after a long discussion with the kitchen staff, brought a tea spoon……sigh ….All in all Sugar Bistro, Galle has a good ambience but the dessert I had was  average and for a price tag of Rs. 500/++ I expect better; served with common sense.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Consistently good food,  great location and service. Their manager is very personable and made our dining experience very pleasant.  Recommend the tapas selection. They could, however, improve on their juices and cocktails, which are noticeably watered down. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Food was generally OK but don't order Lasagne. My son did and he only received it after all others had finished their food. This is normal we were told. It was too meaty as well.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Service prompt, food (fish and chips) very greasy. Churros excellent. Passion fruit ice cream excellent. \n                                            ']
