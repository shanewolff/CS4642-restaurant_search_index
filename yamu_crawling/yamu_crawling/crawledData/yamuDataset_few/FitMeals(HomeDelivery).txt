The manioc chips too, although not oily and crispy as usually is the case, were flavoured well.", "Tucked under the spinach was\xa0pasta\xa0loaded with slightly spicy beef which had a little bit of curry going on, and the pasta, contrary to my expectations, was not dry.\xa0Using lean cuts of beef and limited quantity of pasta cooked in olive oil, this definitely didn't taste as bad as I expected healthy pasta to taste.\xa0", 'The amount of rice was not mountainous like in average\xa0', '\xa0kadeys.', "The curries, dhal and beetroot, were enough in quantity and didn't taste bland. There was enough salt and spice to forget that I was eating healthy. The grilled chicken looked a lot like a honey glazed chicken, but tasted strongly of chilli and tomato. However, it was a little overcooked as texturewise, it was slightly hard and stringy.", 'They update their Instagram with the meal plans for the week. So they have a choice of three per day to choose from.\xa0You can place your order by messaging them on their\xa0', '\xa0(', ')\xa0like I did, or by calling them. Their service is pretty convenient as they accomodate customized orders.', 'For someone\xa0who has had really bad experience with healthy food, I quite liked the meals \xa0- they were flavoursome and not bland.\xa0', "Fit Meals caters to a price niche that you and I may not be able to frequent, at about Rs 700 for each lunch packet. But if you don't\xa0want to don a typical Sri Lankan uncle belly and are looking for healthy (and varied)\xa0meals that actually taste good, Fit Meals is a good and reliable option."]
