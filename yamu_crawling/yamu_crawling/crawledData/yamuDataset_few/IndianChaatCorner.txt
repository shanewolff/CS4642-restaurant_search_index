name: Indian Chaat Corner
excerpt: Indian Chaat Corner is a tiny barely-noticeable restaurant that specializes in Indian street food. The chaat is still pretty good, and they've got a nicer interior now.
yamu_review: ["The Indian Chaat Corner has\xa0been one of our favourite spots for affordable, spicy, and different-from-the-usual\xa0food. While chaat is a\xa0common street food\xa0in India, it's rather hard to find here.", "The chaat house is an actual house, run by a family. There's a boy, and his parents, and I think it's the mother who prepares the food. They used to be based in Bambalapitiya, but they've moved to Wellawatta now and the hall of their house is what's converted into the seating area.", "So it's rather obviously homely, with tables and chairs spaced throughout. You need to knock and call about a bit for them to come / hear you though, because there's no one in front (this could easily be fixed if they install a bell, which they haven't).", 'Regardless, the food is still great.', "Everything's priced between Rs.\xa0200 to 400, and it's all pretty generous portions.", "We love their Samosa Chaat (Rs. 200), which is chunky and doughy bits of vegetable samosa doused in green chutney and tamarind chutney, along with curd. It's quite filling, and very heavy because the samosa dough in this is thick.", "Our Dahi Puri (Rs. 200) was stuffed to the brim and was intensely flavourful. It's a mouthful (literally), but you're supposed to pop it in whole and then munch it down. Alternating between the heat of spice from the masala and the coolness from the curd, this was a good burst of conflicting textures and taste.", 'Dinesh ordered some Bhel Puri (Rs. 200) as well, and despite it looking a royal mess it was splendid. A plate piled with rice crispies (puffed rice?), bit of\xa0', '\xa0and a lot of tangy sauce, this is once again a treat. As with the other chaats, this also had a lot of sev (', 'like dried noodles\xa0stuff) poured all over it.\xa0', "Strangely, the Lassi (Rs. 250) was more expensive than the food,\xa0but fully worth it. By far the thickest and creamiest lassi we've had to date, this was naturally sweet and made entirely of good curd.", 'Since YAMU\xa0bellies are actually bottomless, we had a portion of Chicken Biryani (Rs. 400) as well. We could have had more, it was that good. A change from our regular biryanis, this also featured their curried chickpeas, along with the green chutney and chopped up chunks of chicken.', "It's a quaint, simple location. The family does a great job with the food, and we recommend it. The prices are very reasonable\xa0too!", "Our only gripe would be with the service, because we'd have loved some water and for someone to check up on us once in a while when we needed to amend or expand on orders, but we were left alone for nearly the whole while until we literally had to call them out.", "Other than\xa0the lack of professionalism (but also bear in mind they're just a family doing what they can),\xa0we'd fully recommend this place.", '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Indian Chaat Corner's been one of our favourite spots for affordable, spicy, and different-from-the-usuals food.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Indian Chaat Corner is a tiny barely-noticeable restaurant that specializes in Indian street food.

Also their mint chutney looks like it's coloured from food colouring rather than fresh mint leaves. Hope those can be  corrected on the next visit.
