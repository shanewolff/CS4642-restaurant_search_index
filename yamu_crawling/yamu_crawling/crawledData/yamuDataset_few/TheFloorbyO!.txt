name: The Floor by O!
excerpt: The Floor By O! has been around for a while now, we've been there before and we find ourselves going back more. With very reasonable prices, competent staff and good music, they seem to know what they're doing.
yamu_review: ["Floor by O is the loud brother of Shore by O that's nestled in the heart of Colombo 7, just above Silk and below Sugar 41. I'm personally not a fan of the place because it's just obnoxiously loud at night, but Kinita insisted that there's a window of grace between 5PM and 7PM, so we swung by for early post-work drinks. They've apparently won a Guiness World Record for the largest number of available cocktails, so we decided to try a couple.", "We started off with a Pol Adi (Rs 500) and it was delicious. You've got passion fruit cordial, passion fruit seeds, Lion stout and arrack, all coming together to make for both a visually stunning and flavourful concoction. It's well worth it for the price and is definitely one of the better cocktails to incorporate stout.", "Next up, the One Night Stand (Rs 500) was quite forgettable. This is the kind of drink you wouldn't call back the next day. It was quite boozy but also quite tacky. It tasted like syrup. Try it once, if you must.", "On the bright side, the\xa0Passion Fruit Mojito (Rs 670) was really good. I wonder if they use Passiona for this, because when we asked they said it's cordial that they use. Kinita thought there was too much going on in this one, what with the sourness from the lime as well the passion fruit. I liked it.\xa0", "Last and least favourite, the Grecian Delight (Rs 250) is a beer mix that's quite cheap but probably for good reason. It's a mix of lemonade and lager. Usually, I like beer mixes, especially lager and ginger beer, but this one was way too watered down. We didn't finish it.", 'For bites, we tried the "Hot butter or crumb fried cuttlefish" (Rs 670). We got the HBC option and it was quite a strange experience. At the get go, it was quite crisp and crunchy, with a fishy taste to it coming from the Maldive fish in their chilli paste, possibly. Kinita was put off by the fishiness, but I didn\'t mind it so much. That was until the batter just collapsed on itself. Within 10 minutes it had lost all its crunchiness and just tasted sad and soft.', "The Fish & Chips (Rs 750), on the other hand, was pretty decent. We\xa0quite liked it. We got about 6 or 7 pieces of fish that were coated in a crisp batter and fried till golden brown. The chips are your regular french fries. We'd recommend this.", 'The staff at Floor by O are quite prompt and friendly. We moved between the outdoor area to the indoor space and they were quick to move our drinks and bites for us. The outdoor view is that of sportsmen and kids swimming.', "Indoors, at night, the vibe is pretty hectic. They play the music so loud that you can barely hear what the person right next to you is screaming into your ear. When there's a band playing it's worse. So, unless you're into hearing loss, we wouldn't recommend a night out at this pub. It's alright between 5PM and 6PM, though.", "Floor by O is a pretty popular bar that actually charges men entrance after 7PM, essentially turning into a club. It's mostly packed with men, though, gyrating men, at that. Their cocktails are very reasonably priced, and some are quite inventive and good. You can't go wrong with their fish & chips, though their HBC will go limp and disappoint you much like their One Night Stand. If you work around the area, it's a good spot to booze up right after work.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Floor by O is the loud brother of Shore by O that's nestled in the heart of the Colombo 7.

Actually my boy friend was wearing slippers and he was not allowed inside. Then the fair bouncer kind of guy at the entrance said day time they allow it but at night we have to wear shoes. After struggling and arguing for some time we bribed that guy with 1000 buks ( which is the entrance ticket price to ameuseum) got our self inside. Felt sorry for the 1000 we paid to get inside!!! place  was like hell! such a bad crowd. I got my bum pressed by all most every guy from the entrance to the bar counter. Same thing happened again when i went to the loo. Place was full of smoke. I was very uncomfortable in there as a girl.

At the entrance we were told we have to pay Rs. 1000, which we paid with a credit card. Once inside the place which was apparently empty, we were not allowed to sit anywhere except in some dingy corner right next to the speaker saying as all the other seats were reserved. We wanted to leave as there was no decent place left for us to sit, they said they cannot give us our 1000 rupees back as we have used a credit card to make the payment. After several loud complaints by us, they allowed us to sit on one of the 'reserved' tables. We had to wait till someone else left to play a crazy game of musical chairs.

We went yesterday and ordered Long Islands. They were more like a Coca Cola + Lime mix. Not alchoholic at all. We had to complain it to the waiter and after checking with their person-in charge they took the drinks back to add some more spirits. However to be frank, it was still the same. Maybe the bartender has no idea about the mesurements or maybe they are diluting the spirits. VERY POOR!! And some waiters has the attitude as if we want them to pay for us or something. Yeah they may be stressed out but it's a part of their duty to be pleasent to the customer. Someone has to train them well about the soft skills/ ethics if they need to retain their customers. Finally ordered some Tequila shots. 400 Rs each and all you get is the spirit up to like 2.5/4. Not sure why can't they fill it up to at lease 3/4. The music is too loud for a small closed place like that. Food was ok. No complaints on that. However it was not the Floor what it used to be. Seriously they have to check on their spirit mesurements or should not be diluted. ", "\nEntrance fee - Charging 1500 is way too much! C'mon it's not a club. And they are not allowing to go inside if we are seated outside, without closing the bill. And if the balance of the passes are not transfable to a new bill. Ok keep the pass as it is. But 1500? And it's nice if they can be bit more flexible because our 2nd bill came upto 5500Rs and when we produced 4 passes, they informed the balance will not be paid and for their luck, the bar was closed too.
