name: TGI Friday's
excerpt: It's always Friday in here.
yamu_review: ["Casual dining is an unrefined art in Colombo. If you want to eat well, you generally need to have pants and shoes on, but not at TGI Friday's!\xa0Their menu is varied yet concise, which I was grateful for. You'll get everything from ribs to pasta, with carefully curated choices for each section. Their main draw is still the Jack Daniels-slathered meat, whether it's steak, ribs, or chicken filet you're looking for.\xa0", "We've been a bit disappointed by their appetizers on previous visits (as recently as 2 weeks ago), so we decided to\xa0plunge right into the mains. We got a JD half rack of ribs (more than enough for one human) along with a classic Fish and Chips.", "The Jack Daniels ribs were excellent albeit pricey at Rs. 1750 for a half rack. The full rack is a massive portion enough for a couple to share, in case that's your idea of romance. Accompanied by coleslaw and additional JD sauce, the flavours here are sweet and smokey, with a sticky glaze. With lots of meat, sauce, and flavour, this was an excellent dish. However, I ordered the exact same dish about 2 weeks ago and there was a lot less meat on the bones and what was there was quite tough, so watch out for consistency!", "The Fish and Chips medium portion was absolutely delicious and reasonable at Rs. 630. This was honestly some of the best-executed F&C I've come across in a while. Crisp, crunchy batter lightly herbed and salted ensconced\xa0an unbelievably soft and flaky fish within. I don't know any local fish (as amazing as our seafood is) that replicates this same texture, and sure enough our waiter informed us it was a Vietnamese import, probably basa. I generally prefer eating local seafood, but this was delicious.", "The Oreo Madness was a bit pricey at Rs. 650, but it was also absolutely massive. They were nice enough to cut it in half so my partner and I could share without too much mess, so what you're seeing above is just half the portion. This is a frozen dessert, a fairly straightforward confection of vanilla ice cream squished between two hard dark chocolate biscuits slathered in caramel and chocolate sauce.\xa0", "If you're looking for cheap and quick options, try their super value lunch specials which go for Rs. 600 nett from 11 AM to 3 PM on weekdays. You can choose from different rice options (nasi goreng, seafood, devilled chicken), Thai veg wrap or Cajun chicken sandwich plus unlimited coke.", "The drinks here are surprisingly reasonable. At about Rs. 270 for 300 ml of Lion Lager, Rs. 220 for a 30 ml of arrack, and an array of spirits on the menu, it's a good spot to head for a drink with friends. I tried their Pina Colada which was a superbly priced Rs. 560. Featuring a fresh pineapple slice, a tad too much coconut milk, a splash or so of white rum, this was a light and refreshing drink perfect for a sunny Fort afternoon. It was a little thinner than your average freshly-made PC, but I preferred it this way as it was a lot easier to drink.", "The ambience\xa0strictly adheres to franchise rules, so it's the same red plex-leather couches, red and white glass lamps, guitars and rock music posters that you'd find at any TGIF's anywhere in the world. What makes this location special, however, is the colonial building it's housed in. The upstairs area is generally closed, but if you head up there to use the bathroom you'll notice the sweeping wooden stairs with ornate brass embellishments, the wooden awnings, and the lovely old windows.\xa0", "Our service here has usually been a bit of a hit or miss. During busy times like weekend afternoons and evenings, the waitstaff seems to be a bit overwhelmed and service can be spotty. However, on this last visit, everything from the initial greeting and being ushered to the table, to our meal service and bill was handled by the manager Sasi. He's easily one of the most efficient and knowledgeable staff members I've ever encountered in the city and our experience was seamless thanks to him. We saw lots of waiters just sort of lounging about, but this one person was scurrying about answering peoples questions, taking orders, and greeting people. Impressive!", "If I were to rate TGIF based on just this experience, it would be a whopping 5 stars from me. Unfortunately, the consistency of their fare and service tends to waver\xa0during busier times, so we'll have to give them an overall 4. The food, especially the options we ordered this time around, was excellent, as was the waitstaff. Our total bill for 2 mains, a dessert, water, and a cocktail, came to about Rs. 4500 which isn't bad at all. We'd recommend you visit during less busy times, settle in with a beer, and prepare to get your hands nice and dirty.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Easy, quick, international dining.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    It's always Friday at TGI Friday's.

user_comments: ['\n\n                                    One problem with finding good restaurant staff in Sri Lanka, is that many potential applicants have never eaten at a restaurant with international standard service.

In Sri Lanka, most places will have service that is either too inattentive or too in-your-face.

Pub food of burgers, and roasts, grills and pies, battered and devilled proteins, or light snacks of tuna, egg mayonnaise, chicken or prawn toasted sandwiches, fried rice and noodle dishes and the infamous Kottu.

For one the burger lacked a signature sauce and was offered with table Ketchup instead. The meat patty was dry, and the ratios of meat to fat was not satisfying. It lacked seasoning and the meat was overcooked. I said I didn‚Äôt want tomatoes in my burger (because I just can‚Äôt stand tomatoes in my food) and what I ended up being served was a plate with a few fries, a dry patty, wilted lettuce leaves, and two dehydrated onion rings.  The bun barely held together, and you can only imagine trying to gobble it down was more like trying to bite into 6‚Äù thick sandpaper pack with soya meat. Now for a proper burger to be palatable, it should have had, pickle, a signature sauce, cucumber, cheese maybe, possibly a fried egg; because in actual sense when it is marketed as traditional American burger. It had to resemble it in some way, shape or form. It has to be moist warm, and the mix of flavours should come together in your mouth quite well. ', '\r\nNow I understand that you can‚Äôt possibly be expected to travel the world eating and tasting food to become an expert on everything you eat, so that you have something to compare it with.

This whole review about how waiters used hands to serve drinks, and how they didn‚Äôt know what the menu was like, well when you take a different look to your review, you lot seemed to be unaware about the service of TGIF and industry standards, so if you were missing this very critical insight yourselves. Can you really blame the man (who lives below the minimum wage a day) to know what and how to work according to international standards? ', '\r\nA word of friendly advice, avoid saying things are too expensive, because apart from the actual costs of the food, people to visit these establishments are also paying for the brand. Try and not use generic words while writing reviews, instead of saying service was bad, say instead the service was too slow for our liking and might have been a little haphazard. You mentioned the deserts were OK. Why not write what it tasted like and let the people visiting the place decide for themselves? If I was describing cheese cake, this is how I would have written it: We ordered a chocolate cheese cake, it was sweet but I could still taste the bitterness of the chocolate powder.

Its pretty obvious that the 'management' don't give a toss about customer complaints. They only want our money. No matter how good the service is of TGIF outlets in other countries, the one over here will be a failure on the long run due to the fact that Cargills don't give a damn about a proper and acceptable customer service.

And in really tough rounds such as world history and geography, this team hands in their paper almost immediately the round is over, scoring a perfect 10, 99% of the time !! RE the food‚Ä¶we have found it to be average, portions reasonably sized, but as one reviewer above said, the food arrives at your table too fast ---even before you  have taken one sip of your cocktails! Is it because they want you to eat and leave fast??? Not a place to go to if you want to have a leisurely evening and a chat. Slap bang the menus arrive and within minutes your food is on your table, even  before you have had time to begin a conversation.

I personally have had or tried almost all their dishes starting from the three selections of their best selling dish; The Jack Daniels selection to every other non vegan dishes available.  As a food critic i would rate TGIF with a 7 out of 10. All the items available at TGIF are made using fresh and rich raw materials that can be tested with each bite you take off your plate.  I would say my favorite dish would be the Jack Daniels Chicken and Shrimp and also as a dessert, the Oreo Madness. Moving onto the reason i took 3 off 10- the attitude of the staff is very poor. They would respect their customer based on their appearance i would say. If you're a person who was dressed in brands, they would respect you like you are god to them. If you're dressed in a simple manner, they wouldn't. Considering my last experience, one waiter came and informed me saying i'll have to order soon and have it and leave because they were closing at 9.30. I had to unfortunately stay till about 10.30 and noticed how the restaurant was still packed even by then and more were walking in at the time i left. I was disappointed. Besides that, their service is on time and quick. Second, their prices are comparatively high but i must say, once the food reaches the stomach, the cost doesn't really matter since it tastes absolutely delicious and the dish with the item ordered on it itself looks attractive and picture perfect. The oreo madness for an example; Rs. 600. It would 'atleast' be worth it for 450/= maybe?

Sri Lanka's TGI FRIDAY's  is one of cheapest‚Ä¶ JD burger is around 2500 LKR  and JD ribs full rack 3286 LKR  mozzarella dippers(5 pieces) 1198 LKR with today's rate. in UK.

Not only TGI Fridays but also most of the restaurants  time between the order come to kitchen and deliver it to the guest  is same. for Appetizers it is 7-8 mins.  from the time that Appetizer deliver to guest within 15 mins the main meal have to send the guest. but It can vary from the main meal you order. eg: if you order 7oz mid-rare New york strip cut steak it take only 7-8 minutes. but if you order 12oz ribeye cut stake for wel-done atleast 20-23 minuts. Main thing is most of the the meat cooked in TGI fridays they cook from raw after you order it ( chicken for fajita cooked in same day morning and keep in proper temp. ribs are precooked and sealed and frozen). So 20 mins for meal is kind of win.
