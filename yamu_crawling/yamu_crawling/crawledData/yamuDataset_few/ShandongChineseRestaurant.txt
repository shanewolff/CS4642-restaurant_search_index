name: Shandong Chinese Restaurant
excerpt: Shandong is a new Chinese restaurant in Rajagiriya, spearheaded by a few Industry veterans. They're one of the better choices when it comes to Sri Lankan Chinese delivery, though certain areas have plenty of room for improvement.
yamu_review: ["Shandong is a new Chinese restaurant in Rajagiriya, spearheaded by a few Industry veterans. They're one of the better choices when it comes to Sri Lankan Chinese delivery, though certain areas have plenty of room for improvement.", "We're actually quite impressed that Shandong offers delivery so soon after its inception. Then again, having worked at the oldest Chinese restaurant chain in the country, the staff must be seasoned veterans. Even though they're located in Rajagiriya, Shandong delivers all around Colombo as well as the suburbs, and their delivery rates are very reasonable. ", "Although it doesn't look to change the status quo, Shandong is a welcome addition to Colombo's Sri Lankanized Chinese scene. They definitely have their strengths but certain areas need looking into. They're still very new, so hopefully they can iron out the kinks."]

The mixed rice was very nice and you could even eat it without any curries. We ordered the belly pork which was really good with a spicy sauce. The prawn dish was also very well prepared. The total bill came to Rs 2200/= which was very reasonable. Will definitely visit again.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Food is tasty and not so oily too, real authentic taste. But portions are small and especially rice portions are not enough for 2 average consumers even. Placed a pickup order today and rice was not enough for us. Then call back to complain and order some more dishes. Telephone operators were so generous and helpful to get it delivered ASAP while apologizing for what happened. But later a person called Rayan who introduced himself as the marketing manager called and shows his attitude and unprofessionalism. This place would be better without these people \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    its a good place has good potential. but the atmosphere is not for my liking, as it is very  crampy at times and but i guess that's something they can change now. food was good and service relatively come on time. the number of people the day i went suggested that it is picking up and the people know about the restaurant already. yeah i will visit again no doubt\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Tried this after realizing we couldnt call many other delivery places for known delivery delays and lack of delivery options and want of something different vs usual SL Chinese suspects (steam boat,88,168 etc). After checking thru yamu's Chinese section and being quite disappointed with the lack of real delivery options in and around CMB we gave a hit or miss try to Shandong and they enthusiastically took the order! Was a bit surprised at their eagerness. The order was also taken in one shot and the person also recommended dishes when asked and the total was promptly given - these are skills lacking in many other places.", '\n', '\nLooking for a lightish night-in we ordered chicken and a few veg items  and the crystal rice - all veg items were good and portion size decent for 2 with a few leftovers as well. crystal rice in particular was exceptional.  yes, a bit on the oily side but still ok for that chinese craving you get every now and then and dont want to step out of the house. ', '\n', '\ndelivery is super fast and their guys are nice too they promote the restaurant heavily at the delivery as well inviting you to come to the restaurant etc  - great job for that. hopefully management are good enough to keep the place going well. good chinese delivery is becoming a scarce beast here.', '\n', "\nI would recommend Shandong to have a try - they deliver all around and are fast. If you're ordering late they are a good bet you'd get your food before you pass out from hungerâ€¦", '\n', '\n', '\n \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Do inquire whether a dish is oily or not as it will save you from having to throw the whole dish away (takeaway). ', '\n', '\nThis happened to us since the dish was just not edible at all given it was swimming in a sea of oil quite literally. The staff are helpful when ordering so they will indicate items that are not so oily.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Was there for dinner and the food was really good and the Crystel rice was excellent.Needs to improve the ambience as it is a carbon copy of the yesteryear Chinese restaurants such as Park View.The family rooms were satisfactory and the service was not bad as we got preference  due to the simple fact that the owner Denzil is personally known to us.Recommend if you are looking for good food disregarding the ambience and the atmosphere\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Shandong service is very poor and do not recommend this place to anyone .

However, there is a lot of work to be done in terms of menu enhancements and ambiance improvement. I personally like the idea of  the seating arrangements in an open area, but privacy for guests should be further looked into if space permits. Though centrally located amongst a variety of cuisines on the prestigious Rajagiriya stretch it has the room to differentiate. Also a high level of customer engagement to evaluate the food and experience is also noted. Service is up to standard but i would not say great. This is my second visit after awhile and I'm very impressed on how the food has improved.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Do they server Halal Food ?\n                                            ']
