name: Pasco Food Blush
excerpt: <em>Pasco Food Blush is a new eatery that has recently come up on Pannipitiya road in Battaramulla. It’s only a few meters away from where Coco Citrine used to be (they’ve been replaced by La Trattoria – a fancy new Italian restaurant). If you’re driving past Food Blush in the night, it’s pretty hard to miss - there’s a bright neon sign and a big screen out in the courtyard facing the road.

Your saying you ate 200 bucks of chicken alone. The next person might be veggie so he or she won't eat chicken. That's how a buffet is managed. Said that you don't need to eat a lot  just because its cheap. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Don't expect a lot from the service here or the quality of food - its pretty sauced up salty stuff. When we went it was quite empty. Seems like a budget family food joint more than anything else given price.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    My first time was a good experience,the food was good and we could serve all we wanted for 200!! But the time that I went after.It was juts empty and no one to provide service,so we ended up leaving.Too bad.considering their food is good.However I havnt been here for a few months now so I dont know of any improvements.', '\r\n\n                                            ']
