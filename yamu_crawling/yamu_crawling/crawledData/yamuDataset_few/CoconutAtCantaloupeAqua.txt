name: Coconut At Cantaloupe Aqua
excerpt: I can understand the appeal of Aqua to a certain clientele. It's probably a good place for a party. The beach isn't always swimmable, but there's a nice area where you can drinks some cocktails, watch the waves or even lounge in the plunge pool without getting your hair wet. And they play some decent music. But it's certainly not worth travelling too far out of your way for in terms of food.

', '\r\n', "\r\nI've been to Cantaloupe Aqua and wasn't particularly impressed either. I'd be surprised if the beach there is swimmable at all ever, given the rocks i remember seeing.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Cantaloupe Villas sincerely thanks YAMU for taking the time to try out our flagship culinary venture, your feedback is much appreciated and will be absorbed constructively.', '\r\n', '\r\nOur charismatic and very enthused Chef ,Nandana, wanted run a promotion that paid homage to our namesake and thereafter see how it is received. Although it unfortunately turned out to be a bit heavy handed in terms of the coconut persuasion, it was a good learning exercise for us.  We have taken YAMU’S feedback positively, which will now be reflected by the adjustments we make to the menu and the composition of its dishes.  As mentioned in your review, Coconut will not be launching this promotion. Trial by tasting is truly the only and most effective way to serve the best possible cuisine.', '\r\n', '\r\nApologies for the melted dessert, it has proved to be a winner, amongst our guests in the past, and it is a shame that you did not get to experience it at its best.', '\r\n', '\r\nOn the meat/seafood front, we generally get the very best produce that is available in the market (and received many a rave review especially for our grill selection), Regardless, there is absolutely no excuse for this and apologize that it was not up to par on the day you visited. It is very unfortunate that it transpired the way it did, and we will do everything possible to avoid this in the future.', '\r\n', '\r\nThe dishes that you liked the best are indeed popular with new and returning patrons, we are pleased that you reaffirmed this.', '\r\n', '\r\nWe are glad to hear that you enjoyed the setting, ambiance and concept of C.Aqua and we hope to see you again, so that we can have another opportunity to impress your palate, reveal our diversity and demonstrate our improvements.', '\r\n', '\r\nCheers!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Ermm…its good to experiment with food of course, but best not to use clients as the guinea pigs eh? What if someone gets sick?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I have visited Cantaloupe Aqua on numerous occasions. And quite contrary to above sentiments - Myself, along with friends, colleagues and family have traveled to Coconut and even persuaded the management to open up a restaurant in Colombo for convenience of dining.', '\r\nIn terms of the food being "too filling" - i must disagree. It is filling of course - but would you rather still be hungry after you have paid for a meal and have a rotti at the cade afterwards? Or drive back satisfied with a full belly.', '\r\n', '\r\nAnd to the last comment - Around the world, in cuisine, you do test out your new dishes and recipes on prospective customers and patrons of the establishment. Does not mean they use us as "guinea pigs". And the "what if someone gets sick" statement is quite absurd as the nature in which and hygiene involved in cooking are all that matters. If an ingredient makes one fall "sick" that i believe is at the risk of us as customers - just don\'t eat what makes you sick.', '\r\n', '\r\nBeing an enthusiastic participant of cuisine - I think we need more restaurants and establishments as the one in discussion - as if one wanted the same old devilled dishes and hot butter cuttlefish and rice and curry (which btw is pretty good at Coconut), then i think the only restaurant one would need to review is the kitchen at Colombo Swimming Club.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Btw, the pictures on most of these pages do not load properly, and your reviews are far from being even close to correct.', '\r\nMay I ask what qualification/experience or travel knowledge you have for making such critical reviews?', '\r\nI have visited Aqua too, a few times on visits to Sri Lanka - they were splendid - and the food was amazing. ', "\r\nMaybe you kept the ice cream on the side for too long before eating it - it's basic chemistry - temperature plays a big part in things melting. ", '\r\n', '\r\nOverall - amazing cuisine and great ambiance. ', '\r\n', '\r\nTrip Advisor and Agoda.com will give you more unbiased level headed reviews.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Looking at how this review was done, I think it should have been titled and formulated better to reflect what it is all about. Most of Yamu's reviews are quite accurate and helpful. Yet it would have been more accurate if this was titled 'Coconut promotion at Aqua' or specifically mentioned this at the beginning itself instead of just a post-script.", '\r\n', '\r\nI have stayed over at Aqua and the food there has been nothing but amazing. The balance and fusion of flavours and interesting types of cuisine available is really good.', '\r\n', '\r\nThe overall experience at Aqua with the ambiance it creates, the service and food is something I will never forget.', '\r\n', '\r\nI believe this would have been a good and fair review if all these factors were taken into account, or simply mentioning quite obviously what this review was really about.', '\r\n', '\r\nI think a the best testimony on how good Aqua is would be if you people went ahead and checked out TripAdvisor reviews, not forgetting that they received the Certificate of Excellence in 2013 from TripAdvisor and the Golden Circus award from Agoda.', '\r\n', '\r\n\n                                            ']
