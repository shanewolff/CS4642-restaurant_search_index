yamu_review: ['We tried Mabroc for our ', '\xa0on the day of their opening and we loved it.\xa0We popped in two months later.', "And we weren't disappointed.", "Mabroc's\xa0extensive range comprises of\xa0classic teas\xa0(hot and cold), shakes, fruit teas, herbal teas, and slushies - all complete with either tapioca pearls or popping bubbles. Their Bubble Cubs range, in contrast, has animal and rainbow shaped jellies replacing the bubbles.", 'We tried their Hot Milk Bubble Tea, Iced Toffee Bubble Tea, Strawberry and Berry Tea - all for Rs. 250 a drink and their Blueberry Bubble Snow, a tea-based slushie for Rs 280.', "Chewy tapioca pearls and hot milk tea make a surprisingly great combo! Their hot milk tea was not too strong and wasn't overpoweringly sweet. Not sure how the Lankan uncles would feel about this change in classic milk tea, but we liked it.", "Distinctly tasting of tea with a strong toffee flavour coming through, the mix\xa0of milk tea and toffee syrup made for a great blend. If you're too lazy to eat a toffee, drink it.", "The Mango Bubble Shake was sweeter and had less tea in comparison to the Iced Toffee Bubble Tea. It tasted strongly of a sweetly pleasant mango flavour - \xa0almost like a mango yogurt drink without the milky aftertaste. It's the sort of summery drink you'd sip on while sunbathing\xa0in your bikini at the Galle Face beach. But you won't and can't because we have a ", ' going on.', "The Strawberry and Berry Iced Tea\xa0had red popping bubbles infused with a\xa0thick, sweet liquid that literally pops\xa0in your mouth. It's a slight variant from your average iced tea. The tea wasn't too strong and the berry flavoring was just right. With the popping balls giving you a burst of sweetness from time to time, this made for a really refreshing drink.", "The Blueberry Bubble Snow was a semi-thick slushie topped with chewy tapioca. While it didn't look as blue as your generic blueberry slushie, it made a satisfying thirst quencher on a warm Tuesday afternoon with tangy blueberry flavouring.", "Located at the Liberty Plaza food court, Mabroc is a well designed cafe of\xa0its own. With seating limited to about 15\xa0stools, the space is small, but well illuminated with songs streaming through their speakers. It's a cute spot to grab a drink and chill.", "The service is standard. They're not super friendly, but they are not inefficient. The drinks are prepared within 5 minutes, so you don't have to linger\xa0for hours to get your drink.", '\xa0', "Priced at less than Rs. 300 a pop, Mabroc gives great value for money.\xa0For drinks that won't disappoint your tastebuds and rip a hole in your wallet, Mabroc is an excellent choice.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Bubble tea and chill?\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The best bubble tea in town as of now!\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    තව බබල් ටී ටිකක් බොමුද?\n                                                                                                                            ']
user_reviews: ["\n                                            When ever I feel overly happy about life I always visit mabroc bubble tea and basically try any flavour . Because the watered down bubble tea always slaps me back in place and let's me know that the world is mostly a shitty place and that flavourless tasteless bubble tea places like Mabroc still exisit in the world. A great place to visit to shock you back to reality that people make a quick buck by serving you coloured water as an excuse for bubble tea. Will visit again \n                                    "]

They are about 250 Rupees which is great, as other places are more expensive. The taste me to is almost the same as the other places, as all of them use the same consistency, and syrups, nothing too unique. I actually used to like Bubble Queen, when they were available and used to be way cheaper at around 180, now they are closed. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I'm a chocolate fan from childhood onwards but this chocolate bubble tea let me down so much for the extent that I think twice now when I go for any choco products.
