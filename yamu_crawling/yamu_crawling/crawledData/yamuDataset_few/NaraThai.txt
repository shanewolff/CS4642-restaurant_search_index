yamu_review: ['Nara Thai is a Thai restaurant franchise that recently opened up in Colombo at the old Chesa Swiss location.\xa0We were happy with our First Look, but the comments section seemed to paint a different picture,\xa0particularly on small portions and lacklustre service. We went again for a full-on review,\xa0and had a positive experience.\xa0', "We started off with a small portion of Tom Kha Gai soup (Rs. 990), a lemongrass and coconut milk soup with the option of chicken or beef. We opted for chicken and were glad to see plenty of it. The\xa0mushrooms seemed suspect, a lot like the canned straw mushrooms you would find on a supermarket shelf. A few whole red chilies also made an appearance. Don't be alarmed, this has a much milder kick than the infamous Tom Yum soup, and it's a good portion for two. We would hit it up again.", "Our mains included\xa0the Pad Kee Mao (Rs. 990), aka Drunken\xa0Noodles, a pretty straight-forward dish of\xa0stir fried rice noodles with chilli and basil with the option of chicken or beef. Again, we went chicken. This one didn't blow us\xa0away, but that's a part of the charm, maybe?\xa0Some stories claim the name comes from the use of rice wine, the others claim it was first made by a drunkard with whatever was in the kitchen. Either way, the vegetables were bland and the spices didn't make much of an impression. If you're looking for flavour, avoid.", 'We also took the rice direction with two portions of jasmine rice (Rs. 190 each) paired with\xa0a small portion of\xa0Kang Kiew Wan (Rs. 1190), a\xa0green curry, again with the option of chicken or beef. Ten points if you guessed that we ordered the chicken! Hah, no. We got the beef, this time. The curry packed quite a punch with an acidity that might scorch your throat. The meat had softened and taken on the flavours of the curry. There were a lot of peppers, parsley and lime zest that kicked\xa0in here and there, as we got through it.\xa0', "To wash it down, we had the Anchan Tea, or Butterfly Pea Tea, to drink. To be honest, this was possibly the most confusing drink I've had. Rather tart\xa0and\xa0full of antioxidants, it's a purple concoction that is oddly reminiscent of Ribena. It was quite refreshing and helped cleanse the palate. At Rs. 390, I'm not personally convinced of its value, but it's great to recover from a heavy meal.", "\r\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous, with bright purple, gold and red accents complementing the wooden chairs and glass topped tables. They've littered the space with a few ornaments that are curious to look at, so your eyes won't get bored too quick. Overall, the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed.\xa0Oh, and there's giant bells in the outdoor seating area and some quirky fans.", 'Service is efficient. We went in on a busy afternoon and the waiters seemed to handle\xa0each table attentively, and they knew their away about the menu.\xa0', "Nara Thai is a solid Thai restaurant that fits the bill for both family dinners and date nights, or even the casual lunch date. The food is good, the portions are reasonable for the price, and you don't need to book a plane ticket to savour authentic Thai cuisine. We like it!", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Nara Thai is the go-to spot for authentic Thai cuisine.

Will be coming  back again and yes Christina was fantastic.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    When for lunch with a bunch of friends. it is really Thai food not like what we have in other restaurants. We had the crab, Kale , fried rice  and the seafood tom yum. Have to admit we were happy . Service is good. Christina is as what people say the bright of the restaurant. Ambience is amazing. People should give it a chance and open their mind to new and original style and not following their localise flavour. For sure will come back.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    The worsht Thai food and nothing authentic at all.Went for diiner with a Thai friend on Friday and  she was disgusted with the food served.Totally disapointing and no value for money and very poor quality food.\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    This is really Thai Food. Went with friends from Malaysia Singapore and Thailand. At first we thought it will be the usual thing all change to local flavour but  we wow. My Thai friend said it is as near as what in Nara Thai in Thailand and Singapore. Service was good, Food was good Ambience was good. It wasn't that expensive , you just need to choose properly haha. Well will come back for sure and try it with my local friends. Keep it up guys  \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Went to Nara Thai with a friend with mixed feelings from reading reviews. Okay, the good first; warm and welcoming reception staff, manager and the waiting staff. Great and cozy ambiance. Attentive and helpful staff. Good service! Then comes the food! Generous portions, so that's good!! but the food was very bland. Thai cuisine has a lot of flavor and spice! They miss the plot here with authenticity. The crab omelette was bland… no salt no flavor… the pad thai was alright… but not great. The prawn yellow curry didn't have any taste at all… I had to call for spices to flavor it up! But the Butterfly pea was an amazing drink! \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    When for dinner. love the food. love the service. love the ambience. For a traveller this is as good as you can get as in Thailand. I am not sure this mix review maybe due to people's preference or people assumed they are expert of Thai food. as an outsider I just can say give a try and if you do not like it called the chef and make this changes that is needed. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    When will you serve Alcohol\n                                            ', "\n\n                                    I went there twice. Both times the food was great. The variety of the food and flavours are just awesome. Will go there again soon. Oh! And the portions were just the right amount. And I'm pretty sure that head chef is from Thailand.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Food is excellent, ambiance good tables are to close to each other but the service is not what you expect at a place like this definitely needs to improve to compliment the excellent food \n                                            ']
