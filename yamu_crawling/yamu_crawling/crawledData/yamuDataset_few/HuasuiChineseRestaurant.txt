name: Huasui Chinese Restaurant
excerpt: Huasui is yet another Chinese restaurant to join the many we've got in Colombo. The ambience is pretty pleasant and the food is nothing amazing compared to the flavour and portions in other Chinese restaurants, but it is good.

Foods are not so good at all,  curries were tasted plain as it didn't have much spicy as expected. Overall not worth a penny \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    I feel like its unfair to judge authentic Chinese food with its spice levels. Only Szechuan cuisine is spicy but not Cantonese. Chinese food doesn't always have to be SriLankanized in order for us to enjoy. There are enough and more places to have Sri Lankan Chinese food. Have some real Chinese food for a change. \n                                            "]
