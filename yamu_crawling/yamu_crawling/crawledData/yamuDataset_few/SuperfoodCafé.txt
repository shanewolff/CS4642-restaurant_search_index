yamu_review: ['The last addition to the blossoming healthy food scene in Colombo hides inside the boutique hotel Villa Raha.\xa0', 'Let\'s clarify one point before getting started. Don\'t expect to meet Hulk or Catwoman here or to leave the place flying or nimbly climbing the wall. Superfood isn\'t the superheroes\' diet but\xa0a popular term in the healthy food industry referring to ingredients that are low in calories and high in nutrients. You can expect to see the words "chia", "kale" and "detox" more than once in the smart-looking menu though.', "Healthy food skepticals don't run away!\xa0Healthy food doesn't only feature bland boiled veggies, steamed white meat and dried rice crackers anymore.", 'The menu includes the typical items expected from a café: English\xa0breakfast (with sausages and ham, that\'s right), eggs benedict, waffle, French toast, granola, sandwiches, smoked salmon bagel and "Buddha Bowls" that they\'ve renamed "Lunch Bowls", avoiding any religious confusion. Those pretty much consist of filling up a bowl with\xa0colourful and healthy ingredients. It\'s\xa0one of the latest\xa0trends in healthy food - because yes, Superfood Café is a bit of a hipster place.\xa0', "But let's just forget about the healthiness and hype for now and let's try the\xa0food.", 'This is the small portion of the Tuna Protein Bowl (Rs. 890), which was\xa0the perfect amount of food for me.\xa0It leaves you satisfied without feeling stuffed. The beauty of healthy food! Large ones, that can\xa0be shared between 2 and are priced at Rs. 1190,\xa0sound\xa0like a good deal.\xa0', 'The bowl comes packed with medium rare tuna steak along with fresh capsicum, green lentils, roasted zucchinis, fresh tomatoes, turmeric roasted sweet potatoes, soy sprouts,\xa0hummus aka their Signature Chickpea Sauce and a whole lot of fresh herbs.', "While some ingredients may taste a bit bland on their own -\xa0like the lentils or the tomatoes -\xa0when it's all mixed together, it's the bomb. Don't forget to take a picture before mixing everything up Insta fanatics, it won't look as Instagrammable afterwards.\xa0", "But let's get back to the bowl. I have 3 awards to give away here. First one goes to the medium rare tuna steak\xa0which was cooked perfectly and just melt in the mouth.\xa0No need for a knife, really. Second one is for the Chickpea Sauce\xa0that is subtlety spiced\xa0and really uplifted the dish.\xa0And last but not least, the third\xa0award goes to the copious amount of fresh coriander, Thai basil\xa0and underrated and underrepresented dill. It gave the dish this extra freshness and flavour that reminded\xa0me of beloved Vietnamese cuisine. NB: it probably doesn't make\xa0the safest option\xa0if you're going there on a date and count a lot on your smile.\xa0", 'On this hot sunny day, The Detox juice (Rs. 300) was the drink I needed.\xa0The balance between cucumber, apple and\xa0celery was on point. The drink wasn\'t too sweet nor "savoury" and very refreshing, definitely one of the best\xa0options to cool down.', 'The place is quaint with 6 tables, a massive tree trunk, a swing, orchids and suspensions hanging from the glass roof.\xa0Cleverly mixing\xa0Nordic design with\xa0tropical influence, Superfood Café looks straight out of an Elle Decoration magazine.\xa0', "Set in Villa Raha's front yard, Superfood Café\xa0benefits from the elegant design and holiday vibes of the boutique hotel, which makes it a pleasant spot for an open-air lunch or breakfast.\xa0Outdoor lovers and A/C haters, this is a new place to add on your list.", "I'd also like to give them a shout out for the awesome music background, played at the right decibel level. If I need one reason to go back, this could be one.", "Service is attentive and efficient. The guy serving us, who\xa0I believe is the owner, was\xa0happy to give recommendation and eager to hear customers' comments and feedback, which is always a good sign.\xa0", 'While the decoration and location may seem fancy and showy, the friendly service will make you feel at ease here.', "Brilliant start for Superfood Café. It hasn't even\xa0been a week that it's opened\xa0and it seems very much under control. Food and drinks are on point. The place and atmosphere are charming. These guys have even nailed up the table water, nicely flavoured with celery and lemon. Expectations are high for our next visit.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Not only super good for your health but also for your tastebuds.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    නුග ගහක් එක්ක ළා ඉර එළියේ, ඇඟට ගුණ කෑම කටට රසට කන්න තියන තැනක්.\n                                                                                                                            ']
user_reviews: ['\n                                            Great location, beautiful restaurant, great food & ambiance. The menu has fewer options than the other popular brunch restaurants, but the taste & quality of the food makes up for it & I guess they are working on new dishes cos they are new. Drinks are very average & watery. Since the restaurant has a transparent roof & no AC, it gets quite warm & uncomfortable towards noon. I’ve tried the Prawn bowl, Tuna Bowl, Vegan Bowl, Smoothie Bowl & Granola parfait. All of them are above average. Thumbs up! \n                                    ', '\n                                            ', '\n                                    ', '\n                                            Lovely place with lovely clean food which tastes superb!
