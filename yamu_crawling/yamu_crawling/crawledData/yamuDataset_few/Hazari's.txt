excerpt: Hazari's has managed to maintain their Middle-Eastern standard while moving to their new Marine Drive location. 
yamu_review: ["Hazari's has moved from their old cosy Thimbirigasyaya spot to a much larger ocean-facing premises on Marine Drive. Here's what we thought of the new place.", "For starters we got the classic Hummus (Rs. 320) which looked completely unassuming in its presentation but tasted surprisingly good. The texture was perfect, not too grainy nor mushy and it didn't contain any suspicious add-ons save for some olive oil.\xa0", '\r\nThe Khubz (bread) that is served alongside the Hummus for an additional Rs. 65 was soft and\xa0perfectly balanced out the Hummus.\xa0', "You can't really go to a Middle Eastern Restaurant and skip out on Shawarma, so naturally we got the Beef Shawarma (Rs. 480). The bread was nice and chewy, the filling consisted of finely seasoned chunks of beef, a few chips of onion here and there, snippets of parsley and of course; sauce. The sauce was fine although they could've reduced the amount that goes into per shawarma. No complaints though, it was delicious.", "The Khabsa Rice with Chicken (Rs. 920) was beautiful in terms of presentation. Coloured a deep orange, and served with fried brinjal, potatoes and extra onion, the rice was immensely fragrant. The\xa0chicken\xa0though, was a little bit of a let down. In terms of taste it was alright, but just a wee bit too dry. This would've gotten a 5/5 score from from if it weren't for the chicken but alas, some things just aren't meant to be.", "I ordered a cup of Masala Chai (Rs. 170),\xa0but somehow the tea here is way too milky. Apart from that, it would've been a perfect cuppa because the masala came through and I could taste the cinnamon.\xa0For Rs. 170 you get a fairly large cup.", "Finally there's the Fresh Mint Iced Tea (Rs. 170) which was excellent. I gladly forked over my Rs. 170 for this large glass full of good tea. It actually tasted of tea rather than tea flavoured water, and the mint was prominent enough to give me a refreshing chill but didn't taste like a dollop of toothpaste. Good stuff.", "The service is excellent, the staff know what they're doing and the guys here are really friendly. They seem to know their way around the menu which is always a plus.", "The ambience, is very clean-cut and somehow minimal (how does one be minimal when it comes to Middle Eastern decor?) with its complementing cream walls, brown furniture and a couple of Moroccan lanterns hanging from the roof. We got to sit at the very corner at one of the couch+tables\xa0and I assume this is a good seating area if you're with a large group of friends. HOWEVER, we were plagued by flies who'd skit across our food and skulk around our plates. Horrible as it was, they assured us that it wasn't a common occurence. I hope not.", '\r\n', '\r\n', "There's an outdoor seating area too, which is tiny but tres chic with an awesome view of the ocean. Keep in mind that it'll be hot as hell out there thanks to the annoying A/C exhaust thingamabob that's spewing out hot air because the noon-day sun just isn't hot enough. \xa0", 'Friendly waitstaff, good food, a\xa0chilled out atmosphere (inside because nobody wants to dehydrate and shrivel up in the Colombo heat) and not a migraine-inducing\xa0over-decorated interior. Generally a cool place to get a shawarma with the fam or chill with your habibi.', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Hazari's has managed to maintain their standard while moving to their new Marine Drive location. \n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    With some new Middle Eastern restaurants opening up in Colombo we thought we'd revisit Hazari's.

Interesting, unique, delicate flavours and most certainly not Lankan.', '\r\n', '\r\nDespite originally being from London, with all the 1000s of Arabic restaurants there, there are things on the menu at Hazari\'s that I\'ve never come across there.

It's because Arabic food is an acquired taste, something not a lot of Sri Lankans will warm up to.  And Arabic cuisine is far from spicy, too.  I know this, because I have lived in the Middle East for a fairly long time and desperately miss the food!  I, on the other hand have searched this country for the most authentic Arabic restaurant and came across Habibi, (which is now The Floor by O!), run by an Egyptian. In Hazari's case, they have had to tweek their flavours to suit the local palate and as a result, I feel, they have completely lost the plot.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Myself and 3 of my friends stopped by this place for dinner and were amazed with the service they offer.

I lived in the Middle East for quite a significant time and I must say Hazaris  brings back all that nostalgia in all its glory. As for my reviews, fantastic service - The waiters are helpful and and cope with a large or small crowd equally well. Good manners and they know the menus well enough to give the right suggestions to the Arabic food novice.  Food, needless I say more, it was just great. Full of flavour, texture and well balanced spice levels, keeping the essence of the meal true to its origins of taste. Nice ambience. And finally‚Ä¶ money well spent. Being a typical Sri Lankan, who wants to make every spent cent count, I am delighted when I finish a meal here knowing every penny (cent) was well worth it. Eating a couple of Shawarmas here fills you up so much and cost you around Rs. 550/=. And that itself is a meal! So keep up the good work guys.

Ordered the grilled chicken with khubz once and it was very disappointing, dry, tough and not worth the money. It might have been arranged pretty but there was barely anything on the plate to warrant the price. \n                                            "]
