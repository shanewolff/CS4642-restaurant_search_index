Just because you like to eat food and talk about what you think is delectable and what your deem as crap doesn't really cut it. I like cars, I'm good with them but that doesn't make me a great mechanic or a track expert expert. Stick to what you know, in the meantime take your Fuji cam's and shoot some Vesak photos.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    And what's your fixation on Nawala? Seriously we get the part where new eating joints have opened shop but they are not getting attention due to certain reasons; either the food is as bad as your reviews or maybe cos no one gives a shit about Nawala. Why this Nawala craze? is it the freebies??\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Ah i see Bari has already trolled here…', '\r\n', "\r\nRound 1 - Order before 11am to get what you're looking for- started with  the Lamb (not available) then asked for the Beef Broccoli (they took the order and then called back to say they were out) so i had to resolve to whatever they actually had left…which was the Chicken Squash. Also ordered the Mediterranean Salad, but the guy who handled the order (and called to say no Beef) had forgotten in the back-forth calls.", "\r\nBottom line: It was ok, but I'm willing to try once more to see how the other 2 dishes are.Will update the next time i try…", '\r\nRound 2 - Ordered the Beef Broccoli (early!). Better, nicely cooked…but was delivered cold, so i had to nuke it…which may or may not have contributed to the beef getting quite chewy. Tasted good though…a friend recommended the chicken variation too. Once they sort out their delivery quality, and get a good marketing presence…might go on to good things…', '\r\n\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Hey Bari,', '\r\n', '\r\nTotally agree with your comments.
