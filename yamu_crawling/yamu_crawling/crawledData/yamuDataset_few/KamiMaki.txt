name: Kami Maki
excerpt: Kami Maki is a Japanese fusion restaurant in Bamabalapitiya. While it's not the most authentic Japanese in town, they do offer some interesting fusion dishes.
yamu_review: ['Kami Maki recently moved and, somewhat hilariously, somebody immediately opened a copycat shop in the same location. \xa0Uncool, because Kami Maki built up their own fan base over years. If you want that unique take on Japanese cuisine, you now need to head\xa0De Vos Avenue in Bambalapitiya, near the YAMU Office.\xa0', "The main thing that's changed from our last reviews\xa0is the location. Whereas the old Kami Maki was on a prominent but sun-blasted spot at Jawatte and Thimbirigasyaya, the new one is on a little by-lane off Duplication Road, just before Vajira Road. Check the map attached to this review.\xa0", "The main plus point here is that there's some semblance of parking and the new outpost is not as tiny and sunny as the older one.\xa0", 'The inside is positively dark, and blissfully cool.', "While Thimbirgasyaya is the happening spot, this new location is close to the YAMU Office, so we can't complain.", "Kami Maki has always been a bit about managing expectations. This isn't pure Japanese —\xa0it really is Sri Lankan fusion. Their classic dishes are non-canonical rice burgers and their innovative rolls. None of these have the restraint or minimalism of traditional Japanese cuisine. They use Japanese flavors and ingredients as a base, but what they create is something quite different. It's closer in spirit to Hawaiian or California Japanese than anything else.", 'Take, for example, the Crispy Salmon Roll (Rs. 720) pictured here. This is a salmon roll but with tempura fried something and cucumber inside, served with a good amount of rice on the outside and a tomato mayo sauce. It could be a bit much, but the dish\xa0actually works really well. You get a rare experience for Colombo —\xa0an actual flavor crescendo. The rice hits first, mixed with the sweet tomato mayo, then you get a crunchy hit of tempura and cucumber. Then you go back to soft and deeply umami (savory) with the salmon inside.\xa0', 'This dish has an interesting mix of flavors (sweet, umami) and textures (soft, crunchy) and overall works as a tasty bit of fusion.', "The other dish I tried (everything just based on the server's recommendation) was the chicken katsu rice (Rs. 720). This is basically rice, vegetable curry and fried chicken. The chicken was tender and fried well, the veg was cooked perfectly and the rice was, well, rice. An interesting dish in that the curry tasted almost Indian. Overall it was very warm and hearty, like a stew. It could have used some acidity or something fresh to cut it for my taste, but I'll eat salad (or lunu dehi) with anything. This reminded me a bit too much of school lunch, but it's not a bad meal for a salaryman.", 'The day I went (shortly after they moved), they were understaffed and the service was a bit slow, but they apologized for that and carried on. The server did know the menu well and could recommend some good options and the owner seems to always be around if you have a major problem. My only complaint would be that the bill took about 10 minutes to arrive.', "If you set your expectations for fusion, you can have an interesting meal at Kami Maki. Their rice burgers and rolls count as legit innovations. They're doing a creative\xa0marriage of Japanese and Sri Lankan cuisine, which, while it can be\xa0hit-or-miss, has inspired loyalty even after their move.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    If you set your expectations for fusion, you can have an interesting meal at Kami Maki.

I am a big fan of japanese food and have tried every place in the country. Obviously this guy has no idea about japanese food. The portions at kami maki are huge and you find it difficult to finish and the prices are crazy low compared to other places. they are at least half the price. I first went there about two weeks ago and now I'm a regular and have been there 5-6 times in the last two weeks and let me tell you - value and taste is better than any other japanese in the country. Anyone who knows what they're talking about will know. Im goin back for more at kami maki on the weekend!\n                                    ", '\n                                            Good value and very tasty food. My family and I have been to all the Japanese restaurants in colombo and have tried most of the menu items. Kami maki is my choice for value and taste. They have the authentic stuff as well as some interesting fusion items that kids love. The comfort level is not what you will get at Ginza or Nihonbashi but for the price its worth it and anyway thats their concept and they have a very rustic concept which i think is fun. Its been full most times we have visited so better to reserve before going. I hope they add yakitori to the menu soon. Good job - keep it up!\n                                    ', "\n                                            My favorite place at the moment. I've been twice now and the food is really cheap as far as japanese restaurants go and really good taste. I personally love the sushi and the tempura dishes. The place is a little small but it makes up for it with the value and food. I got california rolls for rs 620 here where its otherwise rs1500++ at nihonbashi. and the tempura shrimp here is rs 720 as opposed to rs 1660++.

Ordered crab sushi and gave my credit card to pay. and abt 5-10 minuts later the person who took the order came and told crab is out and asked me to order something else.Ordered teriyaki chicken sushi after hearing few other types are also not available. it took more than 20 minutes therefafter and had to remind few times about the order and the 2 person whom were there not even bothered about their delay. The tiny box with very dry rice and tasteless chicken was a rip off.
