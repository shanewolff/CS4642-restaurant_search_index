name: A Minute By Tuk (Galle Dutch Hospital) 
excerpt: A Minute By Tuk is a little eatery in the Galle Dutch Hospital. The ambience is cool since it's up on a deck, but the food is pricey and just okay. 
yamu_review: ["A Minute by Tuk Tuk appears to have totally stepped their game up. Since their 2014 inception, the decor hasn't changed a jot, but the quality of the food has. It's a go-to spot in the Galle area, and we even featured it on our ", ' guide.\xa0', "Perched on the second floor of the Galle Dutch Hospital, you're treated to a lovely uninterrupted view of the ocean. You can also choose to sit inside at the bar if you choose A/C over fresh beachside air (you monster!), but very few people do.\xa0With light wood furniture, quirky self-branded coasters and menus, Tuk's decor approach is simple and chic.\xa0", "I've had issues with Tuk's service in the past being either incredibly slow or unenthusiastic, or being way more tourist-friendly, but this appears to have changed too. I still wouldn't call the staff enthusiastic, as no amount of charm managed to elicit the slightest shadow of a smile,\xa0but everything came out lickety-spit. The only issue is that it all came out together, so we had to somehow juggle our starters, soup, drinks, and main course at the same time. Which was tricky. This is what we had to contend with:", "Long story short, the food this time around was superb. We also thought quantity and quality were great given the price, and actually over-ordered thinking portions wouldn't be substantial. We were wrong, and left the restaurant waddling like penguins.", 'We started with a Creamy Chicken Soup (Rs. 400), which came out a steaming bowl of coconut milk-infused deeply flavoured deliciousness. It was a bit rainy that day, and it absolutely warmed us up. It managed to be mild yet well-flavoured, with plenty of chicken and carrot chunks.', "This was followed by a couple of starters. First, a\xa0simple Calamari Twist (Rs 400), a straightforward crispy fried set of calamari rings lightly brushed with salt, pepper, and chilli flakes. The quantity wasn't that much, but the taste was great.", "We also tried the Skewered Chicken (Rs. 375), which wasn't super tender (maybe because we took like 15 minutes to get to it, given everything else on the table), but again held its own in terms of flavour. The sauce that came with it was pretty sweet, which was mildly surprising\xa0because I expected the usual peanut butter satay sauce.", 'The pièce de résistance\xa0was my main, the Isso Curry with Roast Paan (Rs 850). With about 6-7 chunky jumbo prawns well cooked and steeped in a lovely spicy curry, and crisp yet fluffy roast paan on the side, this dish was lovely. It stopped short of being spicy, but the flavours and the freshness of the seafood were surefire stars of the show. Given how expensive quality seafood can be in nice restaurants, this was well worth it.\xa0', "We wrapped up the meal with a treacle panna cotta, called Tempt (Rs. 400), which was nice but kind of boring. We wouldn't really go for it again, but it worked as a post-meal palate cleanser.\xa0", "I usually pop by A Minute by Tuk Tuk for a quiet drink, and know what I'm getting. It's usually either a cold Lion or a self-made arrack cocktail. This time, we tried to diversify and tried the Galle Fort (Rs. 850)\xa0and the Passion Daiquiri (Rs. 950). The Galle Fort was delicious, featuring\xa0some local arrack, ginger beer, lime, etc. The Passion Daiquiri was alright, but a bit too saccharine. The cordial overwhelmed the drink, and I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have my usual beer. Both drinks could have benefited from a slight price reduction.", "On the whole, I was absolutely pleased with my dining experience. It was a long and lazy lunch, with plenty of variety, and not too heavy on the wallet. It came to about Rs. 2000 a head including cocktails,\xa0which was not bad given the sheer amount we ate. Watch out for taxes though. Its prime location in the Fort is also a huge plus, and it's always gently buzzing with tourists and locals alike.\xa0", '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A lunch time look at one of the Galle Fort's busiest bars.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A Minute By Tuk is a little eatery in the Galle Dutch Hospital.
