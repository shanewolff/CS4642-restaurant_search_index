name: Chopsticks
excerpt: Chopsticks is a down to earth joint in Nawala serving a vast menu of cheerfully Sri Lankanised Chinese food. Fried rice, devilled chicken, black bean pork and so on - the Sino-Lankan side of the menu is huge, and most of what we devoured was incredibly satisfying
yamu_review: ["Chopsticks is a quiet, secluded little restaurant somewhere along the main road in Nawala. This is a bit of a contradictory sentence, but you'll see.", 'A dull\xa0yet polished air hangs over the interior and while its appearance is somewhat unremarkable, the atmosphere is cosy.', "The inside is extremely dark, as you can tell from the atrocious picture above (my apologies). There's a lot of weird spotlight action going on on the ceilings, a very minimal colour theme, basic furniture and - get this - tons of pictures of old-hollywood icons like Elvis Presley, Elizabeth Taylor and other stars of yesteryear.", 'Why?', "Nobody knows and frankly, it doesn't matter.\xa0", "This is one of those places you go to with a bunch of friends to sit down and talk nonsense (and maybe get drunk, idk). At least that's how I see it.", 'These guys have a vast menu but their speciality is Sri Lankan - Chinese fusion food. Like fried rice and stir-fried pork and whatnot.', "We recommend you stay far away from the 'International Cuisine'\xa0section on their menu.\xa0", "We also got a bottle of Lion Lager (Rs. 380) but it's Lion Lager so there's no need for further explanation.", "This is something we were really impressed with. The waiters aren't at your beck and call because they're busy with all the other tables but from the minute they take your order they're fully attentive.", "One of my friends\xa0is allergic to onions\xa0(go figure) so we explicitly requested for no onion in any of the dishes and they gladly complied. So make sure you tell them what you want and they'll oblige.\xa0", "I like the place. It's pretty evident, no? There are no frills, no nonsense just straight-forward food and service. Keep in mind that this isn't exactly a fine-dining 5 star rated joint. It's one of those places you can hop on over to at night in your pajamas and have a whinge.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Chopsticks is a quiet, almost invisible restaurant at Nawala.
