name: The Sandwich Factory (Colombo 3)
excerpt: Sandwich Factory does a filling take  on western diner favorites.
yamu_review: ["Previously located at Wijerama Mawatha, The Sandwich Factory has now moved house to Palm Grove Avenue. They opened up nearly a month ago, if I remember correctly, but they're yet to set themselves up properly. Despite the name, however, TSF doesn't deal purely with sandwiches. They also offer a range of burgers, wraps, fries and drinks.", "In its earlier location, TSF was popular for its diner-like appearance despite the overpriced sandwiches.\xa0While the diner-like appearance is yet to manifest itself in the new outpost‚Äîthere are a few seats, but they're mostly white‚Äîthe prices have remained largely unchanged.\xa0The staff seem\xa0new, but they're very friendly and eager to help out. After taking our order of one serving of chilli cheese fries (Rs. 390), a Philly cheese steak (Rs. 670), a roc shake (Rs. 360), and a Western BBQ burger (Rs. 710), we settled in to wait for our food. The food took just over 20 minutes to arrive. That was quite a wait for diner food, and when it did arrive, we weren't blown away.\xa0But wait, let's take this one by one.", "This is the Roc shake. We're not entirely sure what this drink is made of, except that the main component seems to be chocolate ice cream.\xa0It had a few chunks of chocolate, and that tasted good. But the drink was mostly bland, having neither the chocolatey richness nor the sweetness of ice cream.\xa0", 'Next came the chilli cheese fries ‚Äî\xa0a generous portion of well-salted fries, sprinkled with an equally generous portion of chopped tomatoes, minced meat (you can pick either chicken or beef), and a slice or two of melty cheese.', 'We liked this because of all the flavour in it,\xa0although at times (and this is just me nitpicking),\xa0the fries got\xa0a bit\xa0soggy from the tomato juice. It was still quite nice overall though, and we really liked how the minced meat added spice to the whole thing.', 'Given how well the fries were prepared, the Philly cheese steak was a bit of a downer because of how super bland it was. This was definitely lacking salt\xa0and\xa0oomph. The bread was soft and tasted fresh, but the sub was essentially tasteless and could have used a whole lot more seasoning. On the bright side, the meat was soft, well-cooked, and abundant (but would have tasted loads better with a dash of salt).', 'For nearly 700 bucks, one would expect a larger submarine, or one that is at least well-flavoured. This one was just\xa0', 'and\xa0fell short of expectations.\xa0\xa0', "The Western BBQ beef burger was larger and looked way better than the sub. It was quite substantial\xa0and presented nicely. In terms of flavour, it wasn't outstanding but\xa0definitely fared better than the Philly.", "The patty and the bun itself were soft and flavoursome. The onion rings, not so much. The burger was filled with a ton of pickles, and I loved that because it spiced up the whole thing and added a very welcome tang. It also came with a side of the same crisp and well-salted fries, minus the toppings.\xa0This was quite a good dish, but I'm still not sure if it was\xa0worth 700-plus bucks.\xa0", "Despite being up and running for some time, TSF still hasn't found its footing. They still seem to be in the middle of decorating and setting up. They've got a nice place‚Äîit's spacious and in a pretty good location‚Äîbut it feels incomplete and in transition.\xa0The manager spoke to us and apologized for the state of the place though, and promised that they'd have the interior sorted within the next two or three weeks. I'd suggest you drop in then.", "TSF is a bit pricey. It's not exactly unaffordable,\xa0but it's definitely not value for money. Their staff are nice and friendly though, and they seem to have done away with the whole self-service thing, coming up to the table to take your order instead. On top of the already steep prices, they also\xa0have service charges and taxes, so you kind of need to watch your wallet.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    In its new location, The Sandwich Factory continues to serve pricey sandwiches, subs and burgers that aren't exactly value for money.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ‡∂ö‡∂Ω‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∑í‡∑Ä‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∑è ‡∑Ä‡∂ú‡∑ö‡∂∏, ‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂ß‡∂ª‡∂ß‡∑Ä‡∂Ω‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∂Ω ‡∂Ø‡∑ê‡∂ö‡∂ú‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂± ‡∂©‡∂∫‡∑í‡∂±‡∂ª‡∑ä ‡∑É‡∂Ç‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑ò‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂ß ‡∂±‡∑ë‡∂ö‡∂∏‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂± ‡∂Ö‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑Ñ‡∂Ω‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂ß ‡∑É‡∑ê‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂†‡∑ä ‡∑Ü‡∑ê‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∂ß‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂∫ ‡∑Ñ‡∂≥‡∑î‡∂±‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂¥‡∑î‡∑Ö‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä. ‡∂ö‡∑ë‡∂∏, ‡∂∂‡∑ì‡∂∏ ‡∑Ä‡∂ª‡∑ä‡∂ú‡∑Ä‡∂Ω‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂≠‡∂ª‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂±‡∑ô‡∑Ä‡∑ô‡∂∫‡∑í, ‡∂ú‡∑ò‡∑Ñ ‡∂Ö‡∂Ω‡∂Ç‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂´‡∂∫ ‡∂¥‡∑ê‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∂≠‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∂≠‡∂≠‡∑ä ‡∂í ‡∂Ö‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∂Ø‡∑ê‡∂ö‡∑ì‡∂∏ ‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂∑‡∑ù‡∂ú‡∑í‡∂ö‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂ß ‡∂Ω‡∑ê‡∂∂‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂î‡∑Ä‡∑î‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂â‡∂©‡∂ö‡∂© ‡∑É‡∂Ω‡∑É‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∂Ω‡∑è ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑Ä‡∑è.\n                                                                                                                            ']

There was a time when I would vouch for these guys as to having some amazing food here, but as of recent they have been employing monkey tactics like McDonald's: drastic reduction in quality and increase in price. Not a value for money anymore. I will use one eg: their crispy chicken burger which used to be absolutely amazing, full of chicken has now been reduced to half the quantity of chicken or even less, and they thought no one would notice. But to make it look the same they have increased the batter, which gives a really disgusting flavor of batter plainly soaked in oil, at times so crispy and hard my teeth would fall off biting into the burger. And at times so soggy that all the Chilli mayo sauce has been absorbed by the batter making it a soggy mess of a burger. Service is also lacking. Impolite manager. Complained twice but no action taken so far. Multiple times faced situations with my fries missing, and whereas they lie saying 'oh sir its there'. Maybe the new customers would not notice, but the long standing customers do, and I would really love to have the original TSF back\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Went today.
