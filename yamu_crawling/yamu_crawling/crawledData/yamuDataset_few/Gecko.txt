They know they run a well-known venue. The rooms are over-priced and cramped (at least the one we had, moved out to another hotel with bigger rooms the next day). The rice and curry was great though. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Couldn't agree more with the review. Service is putrid and the prices a bit too high for arugam bay. the place is far too dark for my liking. afterall if you are on the beach, shouldnt the place have a bright and sunny atmosphere?\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Haven't been here but they should really think about changing the name, Just reminds me of the horrible creature. \n                                            "]
