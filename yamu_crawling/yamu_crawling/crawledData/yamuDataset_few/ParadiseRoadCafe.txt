yamu_review: ["Paradise Road Cafe is one of our favourite haunts - it's a wonderful white, quiet space tucked inside a store of antiques, art items and scented candles. Besides its full points for ambience, the food here is also quite good. The place made it onto both our", 'and ', '.\xa0', "The tom yum soup here is known for being absolutely delicious. For Rs. 675, it's a hefty brothy bowl, light and flavoursome, with the perfect punch of spice and lemongrass. Plenty of chunky, soft slices of beef to go with the soupy noodles. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a soup this much.", "We also went for the beef burger. For Rs. 785, it's a lot to pay for a burger, but this seems to be the general price range for mains at PRC. The beef patty was very good though, thick and well ground, and it comes with a good plate of thick fries.\xa0", 'They also do a good, milky layered cafe latte, for Rs. 325. This is one of the good places in CMB for well ground coffee, others being ', 'and ', '.\xa0', 'For Rs. 695 we got a gigantic slice of chocolate cake and ice cream - it was good, with nutty bits to break the flavour and a bit of cheese on top. Still, this is where you can get caught with a big bill - desserts are all for around Rs. 700+. If you get mains and coffees, you can walk off having just paid Rs. 3000 for two, which is good considering quality.\xa0', "Paradise Road Cafe is truly one of the nicest places to chill out at. They've got a distinct, simple theme of clean white woodwork, wooden floors and sunlight streaming in. You can either sit under the fan at tables and windows, watching the traffic pass by outside, or sit further indoors where there's A/C and cushy sofas. It's a small space, so service is unsurprisingly good.", "Before and after your meal, it's easy to get lost in the maze of quirky Paradise Road home decor around you and downstairs. The store is a calm clutter of statuettes and lanterns, cocooned inside the powerful aroma of scented candles and the tinkling of wind chimes.\xa0", "This is one place we would recommend, to hang out for conversation with a few friends or by yourself with a book. The food and drinks are good, the ambience is very pleasant, and if you order wisely it's also a good bargain.\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Paradise Road Cafe is one of our favourite haunts, cocooned in a small, white, quiet space atop a lovely store full of antiques and art.
