yamu_review: ["Itsy Bitsy Cupcakes is another home-baker among Colombo's many. They are super generous with icing, and get full points for presentation. If you want some beautiful looking cupcakes for a party, these guys do the job.\xa0", 'First off it has to be said that Itsy Bitsy has a really appetizing ', ', and the pretty pictures are accurate as well (just compare with the photos we took).\xa0', "What stood out about Itsy Bitsy cupcakes for us was how wonderfully generous they were with the icing. There's as much icing as there is cake. The Oreo cupcake comes with half an Oreo biscuit sunk into creamy Oreo flavoured icing - awesomesauce if you're a fan of the flavour.\xa0", "We weren't that impressed by the vanilla cupcakes, the cake was a teensy bit tougher than the other cupcakes (if you're a vanilla fan, we recommend Ice N Easy who made it to our ", "). Still, these are some very good looking cupcakes. The choco-banana cupcakes had a nice creamy topping of chocolate, and the banana flavour is strong so if you like fruit in your cake you'll like it.\xa0", "The Chocolate Nuke was da bomb.
