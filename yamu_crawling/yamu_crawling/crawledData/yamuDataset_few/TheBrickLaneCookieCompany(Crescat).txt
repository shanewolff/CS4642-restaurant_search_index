yamu_review: ["Brick Lane's been around for a couple of years now, and have remained pretty consistent throughout. Their cookies are some of the nicest\xa0around Colombo, and best consumed nice and warm. Priced between Rs. 120 to Rs. 160, they do well on\xa0price and quality.", "There's only so much you can say about cookies\xa0without over doing it, so we'll keep it short and sweet (like a cookie).", "We tried an assortment (one of everything you have, please), and overall found\xa0them to be a little underwhelming - they weren't as gooey and heart-eyed emoji inducing as we've previously found.\xa0Not entirely sure what's changed, but I think they'd cooled down a bit, hence the lack of gooeyness. Still, a good cookie should remain\xa0moist and soft even when\xa0served at room temperature, and these leaned a bit\xa0towards the dry and crispy side.\xa0", 'Our favourite among the lot were the Triple\xa0Chocolate (Rs. 120) which is chocolate OD, and the Classic Nutella (Rs. 160), both of\xa0which they generally always get right. Chocolate is the dominant flavour here - lots of chocolate.', '\xa0', "There's also an Oreo Cookie (Rs. 160), which is cookie-ception because they're Oreo cookies inside butter cookies. While an interesting concept, it's a bit of a clash of textures because Brick Lane's cookies are usually less dry and more goopy, whereas Oreos, especially when baked, are quite dry and crumbly.\xa0Heads up that their White Chocolate Chip (Rs. 160) is quite nice, with a light vanilla flavour running throughout.", "We weren't huge fans of the Red Velvet Cookie (Rs. 160) this time, and, as Bhagya put it, the texture just doesn't come off well enough to be a proper cookie, as it leans more towards a cakey dough, which doesn't hold its structure too well. ", "It's a bit like having a flat cake.", "We love Brick Lane, but our last batch of cookies\xa0weren't as enjoyable as usual.\xa0However, they're still nice and worth a visit when you're looking for a quick and low cost\xa0sugar fix. Avoid the red velvet, opt for the\xa0classics and\xa0you should be happy :)", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Brick Lane's cookies are one of the best you could get over the counter.

We couldn\'t finish it. Afterwards I politely explained to the dude behind the counter (long haired person) and he did not receive the feedback well at all. Got all defensive and said that it\'s the way it is "baked" and that some clients like it and some don\'t. Pathetic feedback acceptance. Won\'t be going there again.
