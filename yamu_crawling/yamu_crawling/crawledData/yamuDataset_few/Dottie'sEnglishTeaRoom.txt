yamu_review: ["Dottie's English Tea Room is finally back! They had some issues with their spot on Rosmead Place, but they've returned on a smaller scale at the ", " birdcage at ODEL. It's currently open from 3-6 PM on Saturdays and Sundays, but are planning to expand with a full menu and opening times 6 days a week.", 'For now, the menu is restricted to Afternoon Tea, a selection of tea, and desserts. We opted for the Afternoon Tea (Rs. 2000 per person), along with a slice of the cake of the day, which luckily for us ended up being a Chocolate Brownie (Rs. 500).', "The Afternoon Tea is meant to be for one person, but the selection of little sweet and savoury stuff is almost big enough for two if you're looking for a nibble and a chat as opposed to a full meal. It came complete with a delicious scone, a soft chocolate mini cake, a Victoria sponge, and a little passion fruit muffin. Each of these was perfectly executed, but the passion fruit muffin and the scone were exceptionally yum. You can choose to team your bites with a plate of cream and/or homemade jam (in our case rhubarb!).\xa0", 'The savouries were a little less exciting than the perfect desserts, as it was a selection of 4 baguette slices with different toppings, like a spiced cheese, cucumber, smoked salmon, and tuna. Apparently we were supposed to get a little quiche with it too, but I think they forgot to include it on the plate. Apart from the cucumber, they were all tasty and fresh, but we could have done with some variety (perhaps a little pastry or two).', "The Afternoon Tea package also comes with 2 pots of tea (which I thought was pretty excessive for one person), and there are quite a few options to choose from. We opted for the classic Dottie's pink tea, and a turmeric tea. Apparently their\xa0newest addition,\xa0the Iced Pink Tea is really popular too, but we didn't manage to try it on this visit.", 'We also got a massive slice of chocolate brownie, topped with cream, strawberries and chocolate sauce. It was perfect - lightly crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. We ended up taking most of it home as it was just too much on top of everything else!', "Of course the ambience isn't the cosy, private spot it used to be, but they've done a pretty good job of giving the bird cage a floral, tinkly feel. From the beautiful upholstery to the signature bone china and the antique cashier's till, it still has that unique Dottie's vibe. We loved the attention to detail, with even the crystal glasses, old-timey cutlery, and feathery embellishments in place.\xa0", "The service can be a bit of a hit or miss as they're still finding their legs at the new premises. They've retained their superbly friendly and\xa0moustachioed waiter from the old location, who handed us a glass bell and instructed us to ring whenever we needed assistance. It made me feel uncomfortably like a colonial overlord, but it was definitely an effective system. As for the accuracy, there were a couple of tiny errors, like they forgot to give us the quiche included in the tea, and charged us for a pot of Turmeric Tea (Rs. 500) although it was supposed to be included in the Afternoon Tea.", "We're exceedingly happy that Dottie's is back, and we can't rave enough about those scones! Head here for a charming little tea sesh, and keep an eye on their Facebook page to find out when their full menu (and those decadent fry ups) return.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Dottie's English Tea Room has moved to ODEL!

Typical English Tea Room decor and lovely homely feeling and everything very clean and bright. Beautiful artefacts around the place, including old fashioned silver teapots and beautifully delicate china. The indoor water garden was very soothing. We both opted for the Passion Fruit Drizzle Cake and a cup of Pink Tea. The cake was unbelievably tasty, very moist and full of flavour. I'm not normally a tea drinker, but did enjoy this delicate cuppa.

The English Breakfast was excellent but everything else was disappointing. Ordered the Pink Tea which was quite bland and the chlorinated water overpowered the mild taste of the tea. It didn't come with the roses as mentioned in the review. There were only two options of cake and brownies available. I understand that the china is vintage but that doesn't mean they don't have to be clean. There was dust in them and a lipstick stain on the serviette in my tea cup. The staff, however, are great - very friendly and attentive, but that just didn't compensate for the overall first impression I got from my visit here yday.\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Dotties tea room is serving a pink tea.

So it's worth asking how this pink colour is given. Anyone can buy rose buds tea tins from China.

It looks brilliant in the pictures but when you go there, its quite cramped up and what ever they have used looks like a prop for a stage play. There is no breathing space and its a completely enclosed location. There is no view of the outside and I wouldn't really go there for relaxing. The quality of the food I had was bad as well. I ordered a sandwich and it was just cucumber on top.  The dessert I had was stale and hard to even chew on. I got a tiny cup for tea which I paid about 400 bucks and didn't taste or smell appealing. The staff was very friendly, but at the end of the day it lacked some significant things to make it a good experience.  A ton of things to be improved. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Good thing first, the Victorian sponge I tried was delicious.

', '\r\nThe place is somewhat cute, not "Incredibly" cute. The outfits of waiters had some frills but they weren\'t "utterly adorable". The deco had some vintage touch, but it isn\'t "fabulous". The only thing that\'s out of the ordinary was the cash register. If you\'re looking for fancy ambiance and a meal that\'s worth ambiance, variety and taste this is not the place. It\'s just the ground floor of a house that looks pretty much like a house but with tables with lace. So yes, you do get a very homely feeling here. If you prefer minimalism, this is the place to go to enjoy some pricey desserts and tea. I\'m not saying the place is bad. It\'s just that it doesn\'t really live up to the review.\n                                            ']
