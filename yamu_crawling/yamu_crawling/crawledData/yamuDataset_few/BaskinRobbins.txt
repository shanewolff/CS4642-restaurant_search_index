name: Baskin Robbins
excerpt: The ice cream was pretty tasty. Creamy not overly synthetic- the fig flavour had the satisfying stickiness of real dried figs and while the cookies and cream didn’t taste exactly like a cookie it was a good ice-creamy impersonation.

I ordered a 1/2 liter of chocolate and nuts. They put some scoops and then, turned the tub upside down (lid side down) and put it in the shopping bad. I asked them why did they do that and wont it spill.  They said no. Anyway, I had to do other stuff on my way home and when I opened it at home before putting it into the fridge, to my horror it had melted and the volume was 1/2 of the tub. 1/2 the tub was empty.  So, what these scumbags are doing is putting 1/2 the scoops less that the actual to fill the tub and turn it upside down, so when you go home quickly and put it the fridge, and open it later you will see that ice cream is upto the top, BUT in reality 1/2 of the bottom of the tub is empty.  I could not do anything about this, since I cannot "prove" it.  But, I am thourally disgusted at this place because they are ripping people off.  Also, ice cream here is extremely expensive. I cone is 350+ (absurd). Although I have to confess ice cream was pretty good though. ', '\r\n', '\r\nSo BEWARE WHEN ordering tubs from here. If you buy a 1 liter tub, you will end up with only 1/2 liter of ice cream.  \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I must say that I went to the one in Kolpity, opposite the Burger King.

I went there because of the HSBC promotion. However, when I wanted to pay my bill, the staff said the credit card machine was out of order. I told the staff that he should inform the customer or put a note to alert the customer. Unbelievable, I returned few days later and the credit card machine was still not working and THERE WAS NO NOTE informing customer about it. Only later, I figure it out that they are using HSBC as free advertising to attract customers to their outlets but no willing to give customers the 20% discounts, thinking that customers will buy anywhere since they already come. Very sad, BS in other courtiers have good reputation but the outlets here are seriously low standard. Never return! \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Place is in terrible condition now, the sofa had rips which had not been repaired, credit card machine was not working and the place was like a ghost town with no customers in it at all.
