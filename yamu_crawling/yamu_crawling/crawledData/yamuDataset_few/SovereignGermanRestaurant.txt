name: Sovereign German Restaurant
excerpt: Sovereign German Restaurant is pretty good. They serve extremely hearty German fare in a kitschy but welcoming location in Nugegoda.
yamu_review: ['Sri Lanka is a rare country where German/Swiss cuisine is the height of finer dining rather than, say, French. ', ' and the ', ' are old favorites, but their suburban cousin Sovereign is actually quite good.', "We ordered the Pot Roast Pork (Rs. 1,200) and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Rs. 1,250) - both pricey but chock full of flavor and foodness (sheer quantity). Whatever you say about German food, it's not subtle. The pork was swimming in savory gravy and accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes and buttery carrots. The chicken had a slightly peppery bread crumb crust and a hot cheesy oozing creamy center. It came with mash and very savory mushrooms. The overall impression here is savory. There's no subtly here, it's just bang in the mouth with flavor.", "It's really satisfying. There was a lot of food but we both cleaned our plates.", "We went at lunch time when the place was relatively empty and the service was quite good. A German lady that seemed to be the owner also came out after and thoughtfully gave us some Center Shock gum. The staff is attentive without hovering, they're good.", "Situated on the Nawala Road near Nugegoda, Sovereign isn't exactly central, but for people in suburbs including Battaramulla, it's far closer than a trip into town.", "Prepare for overeating and feelings of great contented sleepiness. Sovereign is a worthy alternative to the city's Germanic fare. It's got savory, hefty portions, decent service and makes for an excellent if food-coma-inducing meal.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Sovereign German Restaurant is pretty good.

Build your apatite and skip the sodas coz they are hefty portions.

I ordered the "Mixed Grill" and was quite disappointed.   First of all, the mixed grill has both meat and fish.  This is a mistake. You should not have both in one since seafood and meat just don\'t go together in a mixed grill.  They can have 2 mixed grills: one meat and other seafood (sometimes called a seafood platter).  Some other suggestions include:', '\n(a.) The beef was not tender was chewy and hard.  Looks like quality is not that good.', '\n(b.) Pork fillet piece was tasteless. They have just fried or sauteed the piece of pork. It was neither tasty nor appetizing by looks.', '\n(c.) Crumb fried chicken was also very ordinary.  Better have a piece of something like schnitzel. ', '\n(e.) A mixed grill should be portioned for 1 person, just like any other mains dish. This is priced at around 2500 LKR is enough for 3 or even 4 people.  You can check the Cheers Pub mixed grill (meat only) priced at 1600 bucks which is enough for one.', '\n(f.) Sausage was good but could improve in terms of taste and presentation (I.E. it should be oily and look good).', '\n(g.) The Chinese style calamari was a disaster. Mixed grills and seafood platters and Western dishes and should be make Western style, not Chinese style.', '\n(h.) Sauces also need improvement. There was one sauce which was good, the others were not that good.', '\n(i.) The vegetables were also very ordinary. Either they should have something like sauteed beans.
