excerpt: ARÔ Cold Pressed Juices are all the rage now. We tried out a few of their concoctions and are convinced we're now walking beacons of prime health.
yamu_review: ["ARÔ basically did the smart thing and seized the market with their cold pressed juices. Each bottle is chock full of different fruits mixed together to give you all the nutritional value you'll need for whatever reason.", 'We got five of their Pressed Juices (Rs. 400 each)\xa0and a refreshing ', ' and Lime concoction (Rs. 250).', '\r\nThis one has ', ' calories and is pretty much a health elixir. According to this nifty leaflet we got, here are a few health benefits that come with this drink:', "Tastewise, it's tangy with very strong notes of pineapple and apple. There's also a pleasant, king coconut aftertaste.\xa0", '\r\nMore of a refreshing coolant, this bottle has approximately ', ' calories and comes with a sprig of mint for aesthetic purposes as well as to constantly keep your drink minty-fresh. Win win. Health benefits include:', "This one's a great bowel booster from the looks of it. Best enjoyed after a heavy meal.", "\r\nA delicious, healthy combo with Ayurvedic properties. It's a bit of a heavier juice mind you, on account of all the blended gotukola and cucumber.\xa0Health benefits include:", 'A tastier twist on your average ', ', the apple and mint do a great job of bringing the flavours together.', "\r\nI'm surprised nobody's hashtagging the hell out of this one. The pumpkin, carrot and apple merge together perfectly to deliver a comfortingly light tang, all tied together with a strong cinnamon hit.\xa0", '\r\nHealth benefits include:', "\r\nAt first sip, I wasn't a big fan of the cinnamon and it felt too overpowering but upon further consumption, it turned out to be a surprisingly pleasant drink. Will I invest in this one again? Probably not, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out. ", '\r\nA perfect blend of citrusy goodness, this one was an instant favourite. With all this pineapple consumption I could feel my lip starting to swell up, so be careful if you have a pineapple allergy. Health benefits include:', '\r\nThe ambarella was the clear winner here though and complemented the pineapple perfectly. More ambarella infused drinks, please.', '\r\nA perfect way to cool down on a hot day. Although the pear was practically nonexistent in terms of taste, the watermelon makes up for it with a fresh burst of flavour. Health benefits include:', "This is where it gets a little annoying. They don't have a physical outlet, so you'll have to head over to ", '.', "\r\nIt's a hit or miss type deal though because these sell out fast, so if you have a favourite, the chances of you being able to actually buy said favourite are a little low.\xa0", '\r\n', "\r\nAlternatively, you can call them up on 0777666666 and place an order. They'll deliver it right to your doorstep.\xa0", 'Okay, so one thing you have to keep in mind is that these juices are 100% fresh and healthy and contain no added preservatives, artificial colouring or flavour. Hence, the shelf life for these things is extremely short.', "\r\nYou'll have to consume these juices within two days.", '\r\n', "\r\nThere's a small stamp on the side of the bottles telling you exactly when and what time they expire, so look at that before you make a purchase.\xa0", "If you're embarking on some sort of detox, or are simply interested in healthy eating I'd totally recommend these.\xa0", '\r\n', "\r\nKeep in mind that these aren't your average packaged fruit juices, so the taste is a bit strong and the sugar content is basically nil.\xa0", "\r\nStill, with their extensive range, you're bound to find something that'll suit your palate."]
