yamu_review: ['Tammy is a Colombo home baker that specializes in some unconventional cakes. Her repertoire includes bibikkan, love cake and jaggery cake, all of which were excellent.', "Over the past year we've covered a ton of home bakers, who are generally very good for the most part. The thing is, most of them still offer the usual cupcakes, cakes and tarts. That's where Tammy sets herself apart by offering cakes that few others do. While love cake isn't too hard to find, jaggery cake and bibikkan are very rare. The reason is because these types of cakes require a number of high quality ingredients, and a bit of know-how that can't really be learned by just reading a recipe online. ", ' ', "Tammy's bibikkan and jaggery cake are great alternatives to the usual baked desserts. With Avurudu around the corner, we can't think of a better time to try her stuff."]
