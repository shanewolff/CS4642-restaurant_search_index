name: Rakna Lanka (Diyawanna Kotthu Hut)
excerpt: Just opposite the Diyawanna Jogging Track car park is the newly built army kotthu shop. This is the closest place for joggers to come and have a bite after a light workout. They do a chicken and egg kotthu, and that pretty much sums up the whole menu. They do however have a convenient little shop which sells biscuits, soft drinks and even cigarettes.

Its against the law to smoke in public places and everyone should know that by lighting up you damage the health of people around you more than yourself [they dont have the benefit of a filter] cigerettes are an unnecessary evil and should be totally banned. moving onto the restaurent in question it serves dodgy food with a horrible attitude. The workers there think they are doing us a favour. One day i asked if i could get a hopper and the cashier said you'll have to wait 30 min at least. I had no work that day so i said ok…5 min later the cook deliverded an egg hopper and a plate of hoppers for the cashiers private consumption and then only moved onto customers orders. Heard of customer service anyone? only reason i'd ever go there is to get the halapa that popup somedays …its good and costs only 25 rs\n                                            ", "\n\n                                    @taraka: Glad you're stepping up to tell everyone what is necessary and what is unnecessary.
