We tried a bunch of different jars (along with some other stuff) and they were all pretty great.\n', "Since our initial review TST has added a three new flavours, so we gladly gave them a try. The new flavours are the Rainbow jar, Dark temptation and the Mint chocolate chip. Each of them were pretty great, with the dark temptation being a solid choice for chocolate lovers. The standout of the three was the rainbow jar, with it's moist cake and somewhat unorthodox, but very clever vanilla custard topping.", "Since TST is a home baker, they don't have a dine-in outlet, so make sure to call them at least a day in advance and place your orders. They usually bake twice or thrice per week, depending on the orders. Follow them on ", " to find out which flavours they've got planned for the week.", 'Apart from weekly orders, they also do custom orders for more than 10 jars and party orders for more than 25 jars, but make sure to call them up early since those would take time.
