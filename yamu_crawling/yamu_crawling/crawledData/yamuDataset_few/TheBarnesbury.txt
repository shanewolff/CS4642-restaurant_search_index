name: The Barnesbury
excerpt: The Barnesbury is another cafe in Colombo. They've got a lovely garden out back, interesting London themed decor and they do an ordinary range of generic Western dishes.
yamu_review: ["The Barnesbury is another one of Colombo's growing number of cafes/lounges. It's changed a little in appearance since its inception two years ago, in a good way. It's a comfy, quiet place to hang out, especially their lovely garden out back, and the food is alright.\xa0", "There's a really neat, unexpected garden at the back of the restaurant - all white cane and picket fence. The garden probably turns into a great space in the evenings with its old English lamps lit up.\xa0", "The food here is mostly typical Western dishes - spaghettis, meats, burgers. The food is good, if not something you'd brag about.\xa0", "Our pick from the menu's 'roti bar' was the only truly memorable thing we had. I actually loved the roti we got stuffed with cheese and beef (I mean, you can't really go wrong with that combo) - the roti portion was large and of a good firm consistency, very cheesy, and we kept going back to this throughout our visit. It cost Rs. 525, and is good value for money.", "The drinks here, at about Rs. 400-500, are so-so. The chocolate hazelnut was milky and good with that nice aftertaste of hazelnut, but the iced tea just tasted like disappointment since it was excitingly named 'strawberry souffle iced tea', and simply tasted like slightly flavoured water.\xa0", "These guys make a tasty chocolate biscuit pudding, for Rs. 375. It's not the best out there (", " makes a super one), but it's very good by ordinary cafe standards, with plenty of sweet thick chocolate, crumbly thick layers of biscuit, and maybe the hint of warm toffee in the middle somewhere.", 'Our dishes came to us fast, and the presentation was good. Our waiters seemed a little confused though, about the names of the dishes they were serving and about when they should come take them away.\xa0', "The Barnesbury may not be the kind of place you'd keep going back to but it's a decent place for some down time with a few friends. The decor is cute, and the food is alright, and on par with other big cafes in terms of price (almost Rs. 1000 for a main).\xa0", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Barnesbury is another cafe in Colombo.

The peanut butter layer was too thick and  over powered most of the other flavors. There was no 'smores' just marshmallows.
