That's the shameless excuse they made straight away. If that's a bulk order and going to get delayed, they should inform the customer during the call without boasting about 30mins guarantees which you've failed on many times. It's just 5-7mins from Nugegoda Domino's to my place.

On top of that, he wasn't even polite enough to say a little SORRY on behalf if the company for the mistake they did. So this would probably be my last order with Domino's.
