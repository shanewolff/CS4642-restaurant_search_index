yamu_review: ['As the name implies,\xa0', 'Thé Cake offers the normal\nrange of baked goodies you’d get anywhere else, but the selection also includes\n', ' and prawn buns (which look a\nlot like traditional ', "). The patties and buns were priced at\naround Rs 100, which is only 20 or 30 bucks more than you'd find elsewhere.", 'In terms of taste, everything\nwe tried tasted fresh. We ordered a chicken ', ', a fish pattie, \nand a triangular prawn bun. The ', " was warm and soft,\nwith a hint of spice that wasn't too overpowering. It also had a lemony tang to\nit, which worked very well. The pattie and prawn bun didn't quite match\nup, tasting like something you’d get in any other bakery. Holding strong to\nwhat seems to be a Sri Lankan tradition, they predominantly consisted of boiled\npotatoes, so it was hard to know if there was any meat in them at all. I think\nI came across a little prawn in there somewhere.", 'For drinks and dessert, we ordered an iced coffee, banana milkshake, \néclairs, strawberry cheesecake, and a selection of chocolates. The iced drinks \nwere both too milky and not worth\nwriting home about. The strawberry cheesecake looked great, but came wrapped in\na cylindrical plastic casing that had to be peeled off. Glazed with strawberry\nsyrup and topped with a few glazed strawberries, the cheesecake had the right,\ncreamy texture as well (once you peeled off the plastic, that is). The creamy\ndark ganache was our pick of the chocolates. With light and fluffy choux pastry\nand lots of cream in the middle, the éclair was better than the flat and heavy\nones we get in most places.', 'The ambience over at Thé Cake\nis chilled out. It’s also slightly reminiscent of an Alice in Wonderland tea\nparty with deep, heavy chairs that could possibly double as thrones. Well, a\nkiddie throne, but a throne nonetheless. It’s not exactly the most comfortable\nseating if you want to stretch out and relax, but it’s not too bad either. The\nstaff are very friendly, and service is quite fast.', 'The baked goods are tasty, and the ', ' is commendable. The\nprices aren’t too heavy on the wallet either, and you could easily get a few\nthings to eat and drink for under Rs 500. It cost us just a little over Rs\n2,000 for a prawn bun, a ', ', a fish pattie, several varieties \nof confectionery including a bunch of chocolates, and two drinks.']
user_reviews: ['\n                                            Disappointing. The pricing and the presentation looks tempting, but the cakes are actually tasteless. Bought 5 varieties of cakes from here, the only one that actually tasted ok was the strawberry tart.\n                                    ']
