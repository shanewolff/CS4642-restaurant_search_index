name: The Wade Cart (Trinco)
excerpt: I am obsessed with dhal-wade. Some months ago I was lucky to be served homemade wade, and my life has never been the same since. It’s a well known fact that few restaurants compare to Sri Lankan home cooking, and the home cooked wade I had made all of the wade I’ve bought at train stations seem like tasteless blocks of cardboard.
