user_reviews: ['\n                                            I went there many years ago had the most amazing meal… of crab curry and string hoppers and  polos. The only negative we experienced was that before we could finish our meal the manager came and wanted us to hurry up and leave in a quite unpleasant manner. Doubt this would have happened in a restaurant in Colombo. Of course at that time this was the only decent place to stay in Batti and guess they could get away with it. But the food is so good I will still go there regardless of my negative experience.\n                                    ']
