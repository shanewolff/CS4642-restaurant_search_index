name: Barracuda
excerpt: We had a great time here. It's a friendly spot on the beach, very near Colombo, with good Chinese food. Doesn't get much better.
yamu_review: ['Barracuda has grown into one of the best beach side hangouts in Colombo. They do a good take on Sri Lankan Chinese, and their hot butter cuttlefish is one of the best around.', "Barracuda, like it's neighbor ", ", is known mostly for their Sri Lankanized Chinese, with an emphasis on the HBC. Both the menu and prices are very similar to The Station, with both Chinese and Thai dishes to choose from. Portions aren't huge, but we'd say a small portion at around Rs. 600 will suffice for three. Large portions are priced around Rs. 1000. ", 'While the menu at Barracuda is pretty extensive, they need to offer a full liquor menu in order to compete with The Station. One thing that all the diners seemed to agree was that the HBC is a must try and we can say that our verdict from the ', ' still stays true.', 'The spicy fried rice with seafood (Rs. 898 for L) was pretty good, and it stayed true to it\'s "spicy" moniker with the added peppers and chillies adding the heat. There was decent amount of seafood mixed in as well, although we would have preferred regular prawns over the tiny ones. ', "We already kind of knew the hot butter cuttlefish (Rs. 980 for L) was going to be excellent, and it was. This one is as good as it gets with a light, flavoursome and crunchy batter on top of perfectly cooked cuttlefish . We sat there for a good 10 minutes trying to chose between this dish and the one from The Station, but we decided we'd wait for the next HBC taste-off. However, if you like your HBC a bit spicy, The Station might be a better option for you.", 'For a change from the Chinese, we decided to go with the chicken green curry (Rs. 600 for S), and it turned out to be pretty tasty. It was creamy and flavoursome, while maintaining a good spiciness with the green chillies and pepper pods. The chicken thigh itself was cooked well, with the creamy gravy binding well to further enhance the flavour.', 'The double fried pork belly (Rs. 600 for S) was decent, but pretty much all fat. We get that fat is to be expected when you order pork belly but some of the better places like ', ', have a good ratio of meat to fat in the slices. This dish, while seasoned well, lacked the texture and the taste of the meat.', "Colombo doesn't actually have many options when it comes to great places to chill by the beach, so Barracuda is a welcome spot. You're seated just a few meters from the ocean but it's still cool because most of the tables are shaded under beautiful mangroves. It also looks great at night under the lights. You can also sit out on the beach, but we recommend that after sunset.", 'In terms of service, Barracuda beats out The Station. The waiters are attentive, helpful and fast. The food was also ready in less than 15 minutes, at a time with a good amount of diners.', 'Barracuda is one of the best beach side restaurants Colombo has to offer. The location is outstanding, the food is good and the service is fast.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Barracuda is one of the best beach side restaurants Colombo has to offer.

A completely different order was served to our table and when we told the waiter he got the wrong table he responded saying "no, that is your order". What was going on, we had no clue! So we had to be a little stern with them. We told them it was not our order, but we had no other choice to take it as more of our guests needed to take their leave and we couldn\'t let them go without a meal.

Service should be delivered upto a certain level even to call it horrible right? So you can imagine where they were.

On the 3rd request for the correct bill, a group of us thought we\'d go out to the entrance and wait for the rest until the bill was sorted. A few seconds later someone calls to us from a distance asking "excuse me, have you pad the bill?". We thought there was nothing worse they could do after the whole wrong order scenario but this just beats the top runner! I was so ticked-off about it that I told him not to question guests like that and if he has a query there are decent and professional ways to approach guests.

We were quite surprised by the sheer incompetence of the service staff for a number of reasons,', '\r\n', '\r\n1. We roamed around looking for a decent sitting space for a few minutes. At no point did any staff member inquire or assist us. ', "\r\n2. To our luck, a couple vacated a table upon concluding their meal. We sat in right away. Minutes latter, a gentleman who seemed to be the duty manager came over requesting us to leave as the table was 'reserved'. We clarified that it was vacated by its previous incumbents. This manager then stated that another reservation for the table had been made. No sooner he said this, he asked us 'are you all here for dinner?'. Bemused, we stated that it was always our intention to dine in. His mood changed and said that he would go check if the other reservation was confirmed and come back to us NEVER to return (hmmm…). We got the feeling that he assumed we were just there to sit around (a waste of table space!). Double standards?", '\r\n3. Each time we wanted to place an order, we were met with more incompetence and ignorance by members of the service team. It came to a point where my colleague had to walk up to the drinks bar, a mere stones throw away to request for a fizz drink. They promised to send it over to the table only for it to sit in plain view for at least 5 minutes until my colleague got up again and brought it to the table himself (evidently annoyed). Mind you, this was a repeat offense as our initial request for drinks (non-alcoholic of course) took more that 15 minutes to make it to the table. ', '\r\n4. The lad taking our order was cold. No smile whatsoever. It felt as if we were doing him a favour by giving in our order. ', '\r\n5. Still no sign of the manager! ', '\r\n', "\r\nThe hot butter cuttlefish was supreme, the best to date. The rest of the food was average, nothing 'wow'. The ambience was tasteful except for the wet chairs and bat guano which are largely uncontrollable I would assume. ", "\r\nThere were two of us who are in the hospitality services industry who one could argue have a 'decent' understanding of expected service standards, especially of a restaurant of repute. We are aware of the discriminatory practices prevalent within the industry, especially aimed at locals.
