excerpt: Burger's Hut in Dehiwala was the first of the Burger's King clones, but a good one at that. We dropped in again after a while and we're happy to see that their burgers are still tasty and cheap. Unlike Burger's King though, BH is open from 1 pm.
yamu_review: ["Burger's Hut in Dehiwala was the first of the Burger's King clones, and a good one at that. We dropped in again after a while and we're happy to see that their burgers are still tasty and relatively cheap. Unlike Burger's King though, BH is open from 1 PM.", "The Burgers Hut menu is basically Burger's King in Dehiwala. They now also offer fried chicken in the form of drumlets, wings and nuggets. Note that a majority of their burger options are chicken-based. All their burgers are priced under Rs. 350, which is great value for money since they're all pretty sizeable and come with a side of fries.", "We've heard good things about their chicken cordon bleu (Rs. 360) and we can confirm that the hype is legit. While the price has gone up by Rs. 100 since 2013, the quality hasn't taken a hit. We recently tried out the cordon bleu at ", ', and this one is comparably good in terms of flavour, with a larger patty to boot. Just like the former, you get a roasted chicken breast with melted cheese in the center, which oozes out as you bite into the burger.', 'While they seem to favor chicken burgers, they do offer a few beef and fish options as well. The beef steak burger (Rs. 260), while not completely accurate in terms of description, turned out to be a pleasant surprise. What you get in reality is a patty which tastes and looks very much like a thick slice of roast beef pepperoni topped with a (un)healthy dose of melted cheese, which we totally aren\'t complaining about. While it\'s certianly not a "beef steak", it was still quite tasty with a slight spiciness to it as well.', "We've also tried their crispy chicken burger (Rs. 300) on our previous visit and it was a winner. Quite simply put, it's a massive fillet of fried chicken which was in fact crispy and gladly not overcooked.", "Burger's Hut is a small roadside eatery in Dehiwala on Allen Avenue. It's more or a less the hole in the wall equivalent of burger spots. They do have a small seating area which is clean enough to have a quick bite but taken away is what you should be looking at.", "Unlike Burger's King, BH is a much smaller operation handle by a few dudes. We haven't really been here at a very busy time but they're friendly and the service is fast, plus they accept Visa and Amex cards.", 'While they aren\'t really competing, Burger\'s Hut has proven itself worthy of the "Burger\'s" prefix. While their location isn\'t the most accessible, their burgers are still offer value for money while not compromising on portions and flavour.', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Burger's Hut in Dehiwala was the first of the Burger's King clones, but a good one at that.
