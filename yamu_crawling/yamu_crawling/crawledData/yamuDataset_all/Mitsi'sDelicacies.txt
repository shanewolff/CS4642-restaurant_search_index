yamu_review: ["Mitsi's Cafe was one of those hidden gems we uncovered last year. One year down the line, the food is still good, the service is still friendly and the desserts are exceptional.", "Even though Mitsi's Cafe only opened up last year, Mitsi herself has a reputation as a caterer and baker. Judging from the desserts we tried, we can easily vouch for her. The menu is one area that has improved quite a bit with a lot more variety in terms of dishes. What interested us was the new range Balkan dishes they recently introduced. Prices are not cheap with the tab for two coming to around Rs. 3700, but you won't find yourself having buyers remorse.", "We usually don't mention the drinks we have but Mitsi's offers a few novel options. We'd already tried the peach smoothie, so this time around we went with the raspberry smoothie (Rs. 450), which was thick and refreshing with just the right amount sweetness.", "We'd already tried some of Mitsi's desserts on our previous visits, but now she's got a bunch of helpers involved in the baking as well so we were curious as to how the standards were. ", 'We tried a slice of their blueberry cheesecake (Rs. 450) and both the vanilla and chocolate macarons (Rs. 120 each). The cheesecake was creamy and sweet, with the blueberry topping adding a just a bit of sourness to balance out the flavours. The macarons while not very consistent in terms of size, were absolutely delicious. The one thing that I would have liked to see here would have been a crunchier biscuit base.', "I've tried macaroons from quite a few places in Colombo but non come close to these, with a soft wafer that practically collapses on itself when you bite into it and a creamy filling that adds a nice contrast of textures.", "Mitsi's Cafe is the only place in Colombo that offers Balkan cuisine, and from what we tried it's pretty solid. The desserts, what Mitsi is known for, are still as good as it gets.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Mitsi's Cafe was one of those hidden gems we uncovered last year.

The place was empty and the upper deck was warm so sat at the table near the a/c. The waiter was reluctant and tried to explain that this was table for 4 ….

We just wanted to enjoy some cakes and grab something to drink. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but the food and drinks we got were just horrible. Peach smoothie tasted so foul, it did not even have a hint of peach taste. Berry berry smoothie was equally tasting foul but it at least had a foul berry after taste. Lime pie tasted more bitter and foul than sour, red velvet cake was too just sad to talk about.  A group of 9 people - we left more than 80% of food and drinks as it is just after the first bite, no exaggeration here.  Macchiato was terrible. even the watermelon juice was just watery. We were so stunned and disgusted to the point wasn't even sure where and how to complain about! It almost looked like we pissed of the chef and they were having revenge on us! But we were a bunch of calm and quiet people, I'm not sure how we could even piss anyone off. Basically this is the worst food experience I can remember in my life. Comparing to other reviews I hope this is just one off incident - not a regular case of stale ingredients and old cake.
