user_comments: ["\n\n                                    Theres sometimes a reason why we go to a McDonalds or a Burger King. Its service and knowing that there is some authority to complain to if things dont go our way. The reason why Burger's king (now Fazly's or whatever) is doing so well is even there the customer comes first. ", '\r\n', '\r\nHappy Burger on the other hand ONLY caters to the kids from the neighbouring institutes as they are probably the only ones who would rather pay a very tiny amount for ridiculous service. Went there on Sunday thinking we will give the smaller business places some money as opposed to the global players. Ordered two burgers, a side of wings and an iced milo. They said that it would take 10 minutes as they were about to start mopping. No problem! its a small place with a smaller team. Came back 15 minutes later to collect the order and they were only about to start mopping then. I asked them what about my food. They were like "ya after the moppng". I said its been over 10 minutes. And they said ya what to do! So went to burger king instead! \n                                            ']
