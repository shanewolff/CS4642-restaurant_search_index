excerpt: Dwell Sri Lanka's Japanese inspired cafe where you can enjoy great food within a relaxed space.
yamu_review: ['Tokiwa has been buzzing for a few months now with its authentic Japanese cuisine and Japanese inspired dishes. We dropped in yesterday and had a wonderful experience.\xa0', 'While they do have some authentic Japanese dishes like omurice, fuwa fuwa, and matcha, most of what they have are what you would normally find in cafes. Like burgers, wraps, sandwiches, and salads. But of course, we tried the Japanese dishes.', "The Omurice (Rs. 1150) is worth every penny! It was so delicious we both just sunk into our seats. It's basically a chicken and mushroom fried rice with a sweet and savory infused flavors covered with an omelette and topped off with a Hayashi sauce; which is a dark luscious sauce made with\xa0caramelized onions, red wine, tomatoes, and a demi-glace. The fried rice had a sticky texture with delicious\xa0tender chicken bits and mushrooms. The rice went incredibly well with the perfectly cooked egg. The Hayashi sauce was salivatingly good with rich flavors dancing in your mouth. You know an omurice is good when that knife cuts into it so smoothly.\xa0", "The Fuwa-Fuwa Choco Banana (Rs. 850) was equally good. Fuwa-Fuwa cakes are Japanese fluffy cakes. It's literally like eating a\xa0cloud. They are light, airy and made from a cloud-like batter. This particular dish was nothing short of perfection. The cakes were incredibly soft, fluffy and airy. They don't use a ton of sugar to keep the density at bay, which means this was right up my alley. The bananas and whipped cream were added tastes which did not overwhelm the star of the dish, or stars in this case. The whipped cream too was one of the few good ones I have tried, with\xa0perfect consistency.", 'As they also serve quick bites on display, we decided to try the Sesame Seed Bagel (Rs. 200). It was quite alright. We loved the cheesy outer crust which tasted great, but it was harder than we expected. It took all our energy to slice it in half. The inside of it was much smoother and tasted like, well, bread.\xa0', "Vishvi had a gift certificate for a free chocolate cake from her previous visit so we got to try their signature Chocolate Bliss (Rs. 580) as well. I'm running out of words to describe how good it too was. You can probably see from the picture the thick layers of pure decadent chocolate that was lathered in between the cake. It was not overwhelmingly sweet but very chocolatey and as the name suggests, pure bliss.", 'Aside from the matcha, there was nothing native to Japanese cuisine. They have the usual coffee, tea, fresh juices, smoothies, frappes, milkshakes and soft drinks.', "The Iced Matcha Frappe (Rs. 730) was really good. Of course\xa0it didn't have the strong bitter taste of a normal matcha but there was still a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. It was filling and refreshing on a hot sunny day.\xa0", "Okay, here's where it gets really frustrating. The Cappuccino (Rs. 420) we got was utterly terrible. It was bland and watery with barely any scent of coffee. While they do have other alternative beverages on the menu, a cafe should be able to produce a decent cup of coffee. We really hope they improve on this immediately.\xa0", 'Their service was one of the best we have received with the\xa0friendliest staff who were very attentive. All of them were well-versed and professional.\xa0Our food was served within minutes which was impressive. ', 'The place is spacious, cozy and relaxing. There are enough couches for you to peacefully get your work done, with plenty of natural light. At the same time, they also have wooden chairs and tables to properly sit down for a meal.\xa0\xa0', 'In short, we love Tokiwa. Their food is exceptionally good and I can see myself going back pretty soon. The coffee, however, needs a massive improvement.\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A Japanese inspired cafe that does an excellent Omurice.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    සාමාන්\u200dය කැෆේ කෑමවලින් මිදිලා, ජැපනීස් තාලේ කෑම ටිකක් කන්න හිතුණොත් ටොකිවා කියන්නේ එකට හොඳ ම තැනක්.\n                                                                                                                            ']

The chocolate cake was really really good mostly because it wasn't super sweet. The pancakes were also decent although the toppings weren't that fun. Service was okay, nothing to write home about. The coffee was pretty bad. Really hope they'd improve this.\n                                    "]
