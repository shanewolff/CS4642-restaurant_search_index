excerpt: Bubbly stuff and paninis and desserts.
yamu_review: ['Bubblelement first ', ", and we're thrilled that they've expanded into Colombo as well. Located in Colpetty, this is the newest place to get Bubble Tea (and other non-tea but bubble-infused drinks) in Colombo.", 'They also serve up a range of paninis and, sometimes, cake. Meanwhile, the other place you can get some ', '\xa0is ', 'Bhagya and I walked in to a packed house on Sunday evening, really hungry and thirsty. We went all out and ordered three iced drinks, a panini, and a marbled cheesecake that they had displayed on the counter.', 'Our Steak and Cheese Panini (Rs. 475) was\xa0', "\xa0generous with the meat; which was incidentally very well flavoured and cooked to perfection. The only downside was that these were rather long strips of meat sandwiched between the bread, and tended to separate themself\xa0entirely as it was kinda chewy and you couldn't easily bite through it.\xa0", 'Bubble-drinks wise, we went for one\xa0Oreo\xa0and one Honeydew drink, both priced at Rs. 420.', 'The milk-based drinks come\xa0with\xa0tapioca bubbles (dark, chewier ones) whereas the non-milk based drinks come\xa0with flavoured little bubbles filled with juice. I liked the Oreo and Bhagya liked the Honey dew — both were creamy and the flavour came out well in each. The Oreo shake had a powdery thick texture, and the Honey Dew had that strong melony taste.', 'We also picked a Passion Fruit Iced Tea with mango bubbles, and we liked how both flavours complemented each other. Personally, I think their iced-tea range is\xa0quite watered down and not very flavoursome\xa0(tried a few other teas including the Faluda\xa0before this), but did enjoy the rest.\xa0', 'Presentation meanwhile, is beautiful — with the drinks floating in on little wooden canoes and the cheesecake on a dark wood tray which complemented \xa0its marbled chocolatey tones.', "It's wonderfully creamy and cheesy, more runny than a traditional cheesecake. The chocolatey bits weren't really highlighted, and the cheese taste was strong. It wasn't one of our favourites, and we think it could be better if the flavours were a bit more balanced (there was a slight sour-ish undertone) and the texture was more firm.", 'The decor is incredibly nice, with a dull colour scheme and furniture with a white-washed effect.', 'There are funky little wall hangings and quotes, with bric-a-brac\xa0adorning the tables and the counter. The staff are really friendly, and they take time to explain the tea-milk-bubble process to you and what combinations work or not.', 'It gets\xa0', "\xa0crowded towards the evening though, so you'll have to either stand around for a table to free up or just take away.", "There are about 13 bubbly items chalked up on the menu board, and 8 panini options. It's a lovely place to go and chill (when there's no crowd, in which case it's almost like\xa0a high school) with friendly staff and great drinks and breads. Note that they don't accept credit cards yet though, so take cash!"]

Great place for mini meetups or just to spend your time away with a good book. The Fruit based iced teas are real thirst quenchers. The service is pretty quick and the staff is very friendly. \n                                    ']
user_comments: ['\n\n                                    Tried the Taro and Oreo ones and they were pretty good. I highly recommend Taro. Although the place is lovely, it gets very noisy (blenders running, people chatting). Kind of at odds with the cute interior. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                    Wen't to checkout with the guys, and tried out a couple of things, for the price the Panini was just great with the crispy bread and good portion size the beef was a bit chewy though, Tried out the Oreo bubble drink which was good, what came down as a big disappointment is the chocolate cake, didn't care to even finish It was terrible.  \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Visited the place two days ago. Ordered the oreo drink and a peach and pear iced tea. The oreo drink was good while the iced tea seemed to be a little watered down, though it was fun to pop the fruit pearls in your mouth. I noticed that they had a keylime tart and ordered a slice to take away. Sometime after we had finished our drinks, an apologetic staff(the very same person who took my order) came to the table with a messy keylime tart slice. He had evidently broken up the slice while trying to serve it up. I reminded him that i had wanted it to packed to take away. A few minutes later he gave me a small box with the tart. On reaching home, as soon as i opened the box, i was treated to a visual of a keylime tart which had met with a major accident, akin to a pileup on the highway (It was not definitely not caused by the drive home, cos he had so evidently scooped up the mess he tried to serve me at the cafe and dolloped it on to the take away pack). Furthermore, my wife, on taking a few mouthfuls, found a small piece of chicken and some dried onions in the "tart" . Would be very happy to post pictures of the mess they served up, but can\'t seem to upload the photo. Shame on you bubblelement.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I ordered Milk Tea Bubble and it tasted horrible.  There was no tea taste due to the excessive amount of milk and sugar (even though I told them to add less sugar). The service was not professional, very messy and clumsy when they prepare the drinks and food in front of you. Quality of milk and bubble are very low, probably they import cheap materials from China. I will never come back there again!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Hey YAMU!!!', '\r\nthey do accept credit cards now.
