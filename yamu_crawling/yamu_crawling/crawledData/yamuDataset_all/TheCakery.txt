name: The Cakery
excerpt: The Cakery used to be a resident favourite amongst the plebs at office, but they've long since dwindled in terms of service and food. 
yamu_review: ["The Cakery has been an all-time favourite amongst the staff here at YAMU and it only makes sense for me to try them out what with all the hype. We dropped in on a gloomy Tuesday and unfortunately, they didn't live up to the hype (TRUST NO ONE).", "They've introduced an all day breakfast menu which means they've got a range of pancakes, bagels and other types of breakfast fare available throughout the day. They're also running a promotion where your second breakfast item gets 50% off, so that's a perk.", 'The Salmon Bagel (Rs. 680) came toasted, stuffed with a generous portion of salmon and cream cheese. While it looks appetising the initial bite left us wondering why life is full of illusions because the bagel was tough. A real pity because it would have made an otherwise delectable treat, but bid adieu to your dentures if you wish to indulge.', 'The Peaches and Cream French Toast (Rs. 280 on account of the special discount) had us baffled as to what it ', ' was because it was so horrendously undercooked, it tasted much like a bland custard rather than french toast. The only saving grace were the peach slices. The cream was fresh and light but sadly did nothing to salvage the rest of the elements in this dish.', "The Lemon and Blueberry Cake (Rs. 280 by the slice) was once my all-time favourite slice of goodness. However, the glace icing strongly tasted of egg yolk which is an absolute no-no and I regret to report that we didn't find this appetising at all.", "The Chocolate Cake (Rs. 180) wasn't so bad compared to the rest. The cake was moist albeit rather crumbly, and the icing was more of a thick ganache that hits the spot if you're looking for something heavily chocolatey.\xa0", 'The Mocha (Rs. 440) was a strange concoction because it had an adequate amount of chocolate in it but had a distinct coconut-y flavour seeping through. The coffee is heavily diluted by a lot of water which makes it easy to drink but not easy to enjoy.\xa0', "The Macchiato (Rs. 380) was surprisingly nice but it wasn't really an actual macchiato. There was an adequate amount of espresso but way too much milk — not exactly dotted.\xa0I recommend you get this if you're looking to wash the cake down with a caffeine hit.", "The Cakery hasn't really changed in terms of ambience save for a few switches in seating areas here and there. The place is massive with plenty of seating for about 50+ people, and they've also got an outdoor seating area that's quite pretty with cement tables and benches. Upstairs on the balcony is another seating area decked out with giant blue umbrellas and an exceedingly dirty tiled floor, so if you don't mind the crows then it's a cool place to chill at with a group of friends. In addition to all this, they have a play area for children upstairs, and they're known for hosting a few workshops for kids so call them up if you're interested.", "The service though, good grief, was in all honesty shabby at best. The staff seemed to be having a jolly old time behind the counter, quipping jokes at each other and other fun activities. Despite being friendly, the service is heavily in need of some touching up, as our food took about 40 minutes to get to our table in spite of having cakes and whatnot ready-made. Also a side note: they're very good at taking 3-4 orders at once over the counter and conveniently forgetting/messing up. It didn't help that the dishes and mugs were dirty and stained.", "Speaking of convenience, it'd be a real treat to work here because it seems that the staff are granted unrestricted access to the pantry. The servers are known for helping themselves to the food and drink which must be real nice. While the bill was being settled, the server was helping themselves to a handsome snack (a salmon bagel) which I found tremendously advantageous, especially since peasants like me have to pay for our food.\xa0", "It appears that when Bhagya visited them three days prior to us, everything was fine. So watch out, the service here is erratic at best. Nevertheless in an effort to be fair, I will say go right ahead and try their range of cakes. Here's hoping they get back on their feet soon and return to their glory days.", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Cakery was a massive hit amongst the YAMU staff back in the day but they've slowly declined in terms of service and food. \n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Cakery is amazing.

All the counter tops and table tops were covered with flour, chocolate egg shells and other dirt. The sink in the kitchen was full of dirty dishes and pans. Floor was covered in mud. Simply the place was very dirty.', '\nThough it was dirty I bought cakes from the place. They are even worse than the place. Too dry to eat. I took two of my friends there suggesting them that the Cakery sells the best cakes in the town. I was ashamed to find out that I was wrong. I have never tasted drier cakes ever.

Some Sri Lankans may not like the taste of lime and passion cheesecake but it is divine. I would suggest to include more spicy food to the high tea, because Sri Lankans love spicy food and then only the sweets come…. :)\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Although they now have a bigger space the quality of the service is poor.

For instance, this morning, I ordered the Breakfast Bagel(salmon and egg with hollandaise sauce), of which the price was marked "Rs.400-550" and when I ended up paying a bill of LKR 3000+, this displayed as 660 ! I have no idea what the 400-550 range meant, but it didn\'t seem to matter either way, as they charged a exorbitant 600+10% SC !

In the good old days Ellie or Yohan would take the orders personally and the food was always  fine. Sadly,  over the years my patronage dwindled and  is now dead, mostly because of what I witnessed whist waiting for orders to be processed. one time a staff member picked up a glass, had a drink of water off it and replaced it straight back on the shelf. Another time, the cleaner held the mop right into the sink  and washed it out. Many times staff appeared from the kitchen munching away The  last couple of times  I visited, the outlet looked down right dirty, hardly what you expect when you enter to buy food. The service  was always slow and they often muddled up orders, They didn't sometimes know how to operate the credit card machine. A visit to the Cakery could never be made in a hurry.

Certainly we know we need to improve on the consistency of our service. Just to let you know the bagels are freshly baked every day and the Peaches and Cream French toast is oven-baked which means it’s not very toasty – a little bit more like bread pudding. Thanks to your review we will make this clearer on our menu. Also the icing on the lemon & blueberry cake is just icing and lemon juice – no eggs anywhere – and we do not serve Macchiato coffees. I’m very sorry that we have clearly offended your reviewer this time though – this mention of “hype” and “peasants” and our “conveniently” getting orders confused. Why would this be convenient for us?! Although I notice she called her colleagues at your office “plebs” so perhaps this negativity extends more widely than just us! Hopefully you will give us a little time to remedy these problems and come back to check whether we have improved – we will!

I still generally find the quality of the cakes to be good… It's the service that really is the glaring negative. It shouldn't be such a complicated procedure placing an order and paying. Often there are 3 staff members taking different orders, no real idea of who pays first, seemingly making payment at a different counter each time. Staff are constantly chatting to each other while ignoring customers, it's rare for the staff to proactively offer assistance… Really disappointed with the service each time I visit. \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Just enjoying the bashing of this buisness.Anyway im too poor for this place, not as rich as the colombo aunties complaining here. \n                                            ', "\n\n                                     Loved the fact that the bar was initially  set well above average; can't stomach mediocre service after all that. it's nice to see see how feedback is being absorbed as we really want our Cakery back :) \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    service has improved. very welcoming and laid back atmosphere.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    I had the best customer experience at The Cakery.
