yamu_review: ['Coffee & Company, as its names\xa0implies, is a coffee shop. Located\xa0in a gorgeous colonial mansion at the end of a quiet lane down Pedris Mawatha, it brews coffee in a myriad of ways: black, short, long, iced, with milk, flavoured, etc. And the place also makes the regulars,\xa0from breakfast items to pastas or burgers and desserts.', 'Last time we dropped by was more than a year ago, not long after their opening, so we decided it was time to pay them another visit.', "Coffee & Company's main focus being coffee, I'll start with the brew. For this second visit, we tried the Cappuccino (Rs. 380), which was rather satisfactory. The foam was the only miss of the drink really. It was super bubbly and so light it was like sipping air. Plus, with this texture, no latte art could possibly happen. Some cocoa powder sprinkled on top would have done the trick in terms of presentation though. Anyway, apart from the foam and look, the actual taste of the drink was good, the coffee was mild and not bitter at all. Not unpleasant to slowly wake up or to peacefully go through the day.", "We came for breakfast and, really, what's better than to start the day with some Avocado on Toast (Rs. 850)?\xa0The smashed avocado was nicely seasoned with a hint of lime that refreshed the rich puree and bits of chili flakes that just brought some colour\xa0to the dish. The poached egg was not as brilliant, as it was\xa0slightly undercooked. The egg yolk was runny but the white as well, which isn't as enjoyable. Bread was good but wasn't very different from the ", " bread you can find at your usual supermarket.\xa0Also, it was supposed to come\xa0with feta and roasted tomatoes but to my great disappointment, we\xa0couldn't trace any Greek cheese and there only were 2 measly slices of fresh tomatoes on the plate.", 'We also got a Cookie for about Rs. 120 and it clearly was a bad choice. The biscuit had\xa0probably been made the week before and was as hard as a rock. Or almost. It was OK-ish after dipping it in the cap for\xa0a good 30 seconds. But still the taste was not mind blowing.', "Service is\xa0efficient and the staff\xa0friendly.\xa0The coffee and cookie came straight away and we didn't have to wait for long for the avocado toasts either.\xa0", "The ambience is really what we'll make us come back to Coffee & Company. The interior decoration matches the charm of the outside. Everything there\xa0is leather, wood and\xa0cane and the dominant colours are warm varieties of brown,\xa0beige and yellow and some notes of black and grey.\xa0The jazzy music in the background adds to the elegance of the place.\xa0", 'You can choose to sit on comfy Parisian bistro looking chairs, to curl up on one the 2 imposing armchairs or to crash on the inviting sofa. You can also decide to make the best\xa0of their big garden and terrace outside.', "Coffee & Company struck\xa0me as a great place for a date, as it's kind of romantic and really quiet and tranquil. It can also be a good hideout to gather your friends or relatives and while away the heat or the hours on a lazy afternoon. And it\xa0definitely makes an awesome book nook to add on to our\xa0", '.\xa0', "Coffee & Company is an ideal spot to wind up with your loved one(s), may they be your lover, friends or\xa0books. Order a drink (and food if you're really starving) and enjoy the quietness.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Stylish and quiet café located in a lane down Pedris Mawatha.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Located down a quiet lane on 30th Lane via Pedris Mawatha, Coffee & Co is the newest addition  to Colombo's multitude of coffeeshops.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ඔයාලත් හවස් වරුවක ගෙදර යන ගමන් පොඩ්ඩක් මේකට ගොඩ වෙලා බලන්නකෝ. මහන්සිය කොහේ ගියා ද නැති වේවි. \xa0\n                                                                                                                            ']
