name: Raja Bojun
excerpt: Raja Bojun is generally known for good Sri Lankan cuisine. They've moved from their old spot near Galle Face to a new location at the top of Liberty Arcade. The food is still good, so is the spread, though nothing amazing. We loved the seafood best.
yamu_review: ['Raja Bojun is\xa0one of\xa0', "\xa0go-to places for Sri Lankan food, especially if you want to introduce local dishes to your non-Ceylonese friends, but we honestly don't know why because the food and service don't live up to even the lowest of expectations.", "When we first reviewed it about three years ago, Raja Bojun didn't disappoint. The rice and curry were top notch, but the notches seems to have loosened quite a bit since then.", 'Dili and I walked in for lunch one fine afternoon, and were ushered to a table as soon as we entered. The staff seemed welcoming and nice, and then promptly forgot about us even though we were practically the only other people there at that time (before a few other customers walked in a little while later). We called for the menu twice, and it eventually found its way to us about 20 minutes later.\xa0', 'Having finally acquired the menu and being quite ravenous by now, we ordered a Mulligatawny Soup (Rs. 542), a Vegetable Fried Rice with Chicken off their rice and curry options (Rs. 1,032), and a Chicken Kottu (Rs. 968).\xa0', "Our soup arrived first, another 20 plus\xa0minutes later by which time we wondered if they'd forgotten about us again. The soup was alright, non-offensive and passable. It had plenty of lentils in and a hint of spice. This was the best part of our meal.", 'The vegetable fried\xa0rice and curry that followed was sad, to say the least. It did have a lot of chopped up carrots and leeks in it, but it also had an immense amount of oil. Overall, it lacked flavour of any sort and just tasted glutinous, rather like a bad Chinese fried rice.', "The accompanying dish of chicken was... well, bite-sized to say the least. If you're paying over a thousand rupees for a rice and curry, the least it could be is well made or sufficient in portion. Note the table spoon for size comparisions.", 'Our Chicken Kottu was mostly egg, and tasted rather like the', ' one gets from ', ", minus the satisfying meat in it. It wasn't really filling, and we're not sure how anyone could get a kottu so wrong. On the plus side, it did look visually appealing.", '\xa0', "One major plus point for Raja Bojun is their wonderful space. A large, super-well lit dining area that's maintained quite well, the restaurant is on the rooftop of the Liberty Arcade. There are plenty of tables and chairs laid symmetrically out, and one end of the large room is laid out for their buffet.", 'It has a very tropical touch to it what with a large elephant statue on one end, and a few ornamental trees placed around.', '\xa0', "We spent an overall of just over Rs. 2,500 for our meal, which was basically a soup, a kottu,\xa0an abysmal fried rice and curry, and incredibly inefficient service throughout. It was quite sad to see how Raja Bojun has dropped, but we're hoping it was an off-day. Let us know if your experience was any different.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Once known for its great Sri Lankan fare, Raja Bojun now disappoints.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Raja Bojun is generally known for good Sri Lankan cuisine.
