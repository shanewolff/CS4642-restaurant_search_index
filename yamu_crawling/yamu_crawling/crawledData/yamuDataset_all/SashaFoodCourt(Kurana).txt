name: Sasha Food Court (Kurana)
excerpt: A one-stop shop on the way to/from airport or to your getaway. 
yamu_review: ["It's like a family tradition.\xa0No ride to the airport, aachchi's place or a\xa0holiday destination up North is complete without a\xa0halt at Sasha Food Court.\xa0", "Apart from the naans, there's nothing fantastic about this place but the handy location, big\xa0car park, decent food\xa0and efficient service\xa0make it a restorative stop on a road trip.", 'Fresh juices, teas, coffees, rice,\xa0sandwiches, pastries, naans, koththus, pizzas, pastas, Chinese food, sweets, Sasha Food Court caters to all needs and budgets.', 'Last time we stopped by, we tried their Chicken Biryani (Rs. 520). It was a decent biryani showcasing a lot of different flavours and spices. The basmati rice was well cooked and\xa0was soft, and\xa0aromatic. The fried chicken leg on the other hand was a bit dry and not that crunchy. Same goes for the deep-fried egg.\xa0The piece of roasted pineapple and the\xa0mango chutney added an unusual but\xa0interesting sweet touch\xa0to the dish and the cucumber salad was a good\xa0addition to cool down and refresh our palate.', "We\xa0shared another classic, the Lamprais (spelled Lump Rice at the shop)\xa0at Rs. 480. The banana leaf\xa0held a substantial amount of fiery and fragrant samba rice, a piece of chicken (that I assume was tasty as my partners in crime on that\xa0day didn't even let me a bite of it), a deep-fried egg, one tasty\xa0cutlet we\xa0fought for, brinjal, seeni sambol and\xa0some sort of spicy chutney. I'm no lamprais expert so I won't be able to rate the authenticity of the dish but I thought all the elements\xa0worked well together.\xa0", 'We were pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Noodles (Rs. 620). For some obscure reason, noodle\xa0dishes\xa0tend to be on the boring side of the food chain. Subtlety spiced with chili and flavoured with tender chicken,\xa0fried curry leaves and vegetables,\xa0these noodles\xa0defied our expectations.', "Last but not least, the Garlic Naans (Rs.120 each), that, given the\xa0size of it,\xa0they should seriously consider renaming\xa0garlic pizzas.\xa0Cooked on order, they always come fresh out of the traditional naan oven. Nicely buttery and super garlicky, they're a treat.", "The other day, we paired it with Butter Chicken (Rs. 200), which is probably not the best option. Nothing bad about it but nothing crazy\xa0either. The consistency of the gravy was OK but the taste lacked character. I ended up having my giant garlic naan by itself, which I didn't really mind anyway.\xa0", "We washed everything off with a rich and spicy\xa0Masala Tea, priced at Rs. 80 a cup. Deliciously creamy\xa0and featuring strong notes of cinnamon and cardamom, you're in for a hearty cuppa.", "As stated in the restaurant name itself, Sasha\xa0is a food court and as such it isn't\xa0what I'd describe as a glamourous place but again, as a pit stop, it\xa0has everything you could wish for: big car park, clean bathroom and even a\xa0playground for kids at the back.", "Service is super efficient,\xa0you won't wait for long to be served. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and portion\xa0sizes.", "Sasha Food Court is a convenient eatery when you're\xa0in the area and feeling peckish. Stop for a naan, a masala tea or a fresh juice and hit the road again.\xa0"]

Went for a snack in the evening with family there was nothing at all. So disappointing when compared to the other branches of Sasha which are great.\n                                    ']
