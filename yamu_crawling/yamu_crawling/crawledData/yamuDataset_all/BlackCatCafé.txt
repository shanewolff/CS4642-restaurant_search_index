excerpt: The Black Cat Café serves up amazing sandwiches, coffee, and fresh fruit juices. They're also a B+B.
yamu_review: ['Centuries ago, Aisha visited\xa0Black\xa0Cat\xa0and gave it five stars amidst much controversy and accusations of corruption. We went back recently to check out their new menu and if the place is still as cool as she claimed it was.\xa0', 'While it’s great coffee and food certainly plays a role, how\xa0Black\xa0Cat\xa0really wins is through a thoughtfully curated ambiance and an amazingly laid back (but efficient) service approach that really makes you feel at home.', "The new menu is divided into two. There's the breakfast menu which lasts until noon, and then another menu\xa0for the afternoon and evenings.", 'We tried two items from the breakfast menu and were a little underwhelmed by both. The Gone Troppo (Rs. 1200) had a selection of seasonal tropical fruit on Swiss muesli, complemented by buffalo curd, milk, and ', " treacle. We thought there could have been a few more fruits in it, also the buffalo curd seemed to be your standard off-the-shelf supermarket variety. Not what you'd expect for the price.", 'The Eggs Colombo (Rs. 1100) usually comes with sprats, but we tried it with smoked salmon because the kitchen was out of sprats on that day. It tasted\xa0pretty good, felt healthy and the extra toast was welcome. Although, the\xa0', " greens weren't quite gelling with the whole dish for me.", "I only tried\xa0the Mezze Platter (Rs. 1200) from the afternoon menu. It was really good.\xa0The hummus was\xa0had a soft, slightly grainy texture. It comes with cut up veggies; carrots and cucumbers as well as a bit of Tabouleh with nicely seasoned, fresh and crunchy parsley. This dish also has a very good harissa hot sauce that really hits the spot. It's bloody good to taste some unabashedly spicy stuff at a time where menus across the country are getting progressively blander.\xa0", 'Different kinds of cakes and desserts will pop up and\xa0Black\xa0Cat\xa0as and when they get made. Aunty Nimi’s Date Cake was the bomb. Not too sweet and served with vanilla ice cream on a tray that blended with the table, facilitating minimalist photography opportunities.', 'The classic homemade ginger beer (Rs. 400) was not as good as I remember. It was so sharp, the ginger almost burned my throat on the way down. It also had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Is this some sort of purist’s ginger beer that’s just a little too hardcore for my amateur taste buds or just an off-batch?', ' The Peach and Cinnamon Ice Tea (Rs. 400) had great mouthfeel but ultimately was a little too syrupy sweet.\xa0The coffee here is as good as anywhere else. The Cappuccino is both perfectly balanced doses of caffeine for sleepy mornings and afternoons alike.\xa0', 'On weekends\xa0Black\xa0Cat\xa0is a little too noisy on the inside. It’s echoey, sometimes the music can be loud-ish and raised voices of aunty-get-togethers reverberate through the room. Things vastly improve on weekdays though, I guess weekends aren’t for work. Also the wifi here is usually terrific, albeit less so on the outside. Power outlets are limited to certain corners, and there are none in the outside seating areas.', 'The furniture is cute but sometimes inconvenient. There are tables made out of doors, whose sharp edges and still-attached hinges can cut into you, and some made out of sewing machine stands that get in the way of your limbs. There is no need to sit at the hipster fittings if you don’t want to though, bag one of the many comfy armchairs/couches instead.', 'The service here can seem a little matter of fact in the beginning, but the initially gruff exterior masks a genuine friendliness. Staff tend to recognize you by sight of you’re a regular, and there is a stark absence of dirty looks when you stay for longer than is decent. There seems to be a focus on relationship building as an approach to service and that really makes a difference.', 'The outside seating area, shared with ', ', is one of the best in Colombo, only matched by ', '’s expansive garden set-up IMO. There are comfortable armchairs that remind you of your grandfather’s living room, and the limited space is designed efficiently enough to afford a surprising amount of secluded privacy.', 'You can BYOB or smoke\xa0and chill for hours on end, even after the cafe is closed.\xa0', "It's still great. Full points for service, ambiance, and drinks.

Service, wifi and can I smoke. Passed on all 3 with flying colours. (Obviously smoked outside). I will be going back there definitely. Will venture towards a breakfast later this week. I love the building too, great colonial architecture that has been well looked after. Ok, there is a down side! Not the cat so much but the three legged dog that wouldn't stop barking, a real nuisance and a pain in the butt. Why does a cool and classy cafe allow a mangy, flea-ridden three legged mutt to wander around the premises barking is disease ridden head off is beyond me. Get rid off the mutt and I'd give 5 stars, keep it there and I won't bother rating the place. Sri Lanka needs to step it up with allowing unhygienic dogs wander around their establishments, they'd loose their licence in most European countries for allowing it. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    It's a rescue dog, the cafe has deep compassion which is awesome. Also I'm sure the dog does not have fleas or decease as he's well looked after. If you don't like thier concept, you can not go there again \n                                            ", '\n\n                                    Seriously?\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    That was at Brian. Seriously what a 1st class a hole\n                                            ']
