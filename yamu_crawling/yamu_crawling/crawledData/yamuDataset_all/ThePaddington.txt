name: The Paddington
excerpt: The new address they relocated to is easily accessible and there is plenty of parking. From a food POV, it may not impress everyone but the place sure is somewhere we can all relax at.
yamu_review: ['If only their food was as good as their ambience, The Paddington would be my go-to spot in town.', 'This coffee-shop (which just moved) has an ideal location in the heart of Colombo and\xa0a spacious interior for groups but the food and drinks\xa0are nothing special.', "The Chili Seafood Crepes (Rs. 1100) were an intriguing take on the traditional crepe with a creamy seafood filling loaded with stubby chunks of prawns. I expected a richer and spicier flavour from the\xa0seafood than just bland, melted cheese.Speaking of cheese, they'd haphazardly placed half melted cheese on top of the two crepes which created\xa0quite an eyesore. Nonetheless, the crepe was thin and not too doughy so at least it was enjoyable to an extent.", "Tex Mex Grilled Chicken Burger (Rs.795) was too basic for me; from the presentation to the burger itself. If I was to ever have time to quickly throw together a burger at home, this is probably what I'd produce.", "The chicken was juicy and fulfilling but the outter layer was not charred enough to be a perfectly grilled chicken breast. And the fries were not crispy enough. I'd not pay this much for a burger that looks (and tastes) like this again.", "McDonald's, here I come for a better burger...", "Though the Cozy Hot Chocolate (Rs. 695) didn't amaze me, at least they had an acceptable one which was not too sweet unlike some places.I sure was looking for a richer taste of chocolate but the milky flavour overpowered the entire cup (extra chocolate never hurt nobody). Overall, the best part of the drink was merely sipping on the foam.\xa0", 'We loved the different settings they offer: from a laid back garden with swing chairs to a more intimate setting inside with leather seats, warm yellow lighting and a lot of brown wooden structures surrounding the place.\xa0', 'The interior\xa0gave the place a vintage vibe with the windows, door frames and monochrome pictures on the walls.', 'Moreover, service at the Paddington was something I liked. The staff members were really friendly and checked with me occasionally if I was enjoying the food (although some may find this annoying).', "We recommend this place ONLY\xa0if you are really (really) hungry or thirsty.\xa0However if you're looking for a place to chill with your friends while you kick back with no shoes on, then go here.", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    With mediocre food and drinks, as well as poor presentation, there is definitely a lot of room for improvement.

Tried the baked crab with garlic and was worth every penny. There is plenty of crab meat, well cooked with a layer of cheese on top. The prices although relatively on the high side in comparison with restaurants of the same nature, are average. The staff are super friendly and helpful and definitely a good place to chill out.

Sadly these owners decided to open it right down the road from the competition. Which brings me to think why they would do that ? No smart investor (who wanted to make something out of the investment) would ever put money into something like this unless there were other objectives.

My husband opened the box (which was sellotaped shut and exactly the same as it had been when he left it as the reception with instructions to bring it up all decked out), and the waiter reappeared, asking if he can place the candles and bring it back. So much for the big surprise!  A request for matches and the waiter vanished for a good half an hour, only to reappear after the cake had been cut and eaten.

There was also a distinct musty smell as if the floor had been mopped with a dirty mop or the furniture had been wiped down with a dirty cloth and none of the lights were turned on despite it being quite dark and depressing looking inside due to the generally cloudy weather these days. The waiters tried their best to be accommodating but the overall place was a shambles. We ordered the nasi goreng and waffles. The waffles were alright but the nasi was awful. Mushy, severly lacking with the promised seafood  and overpowered with pepper. I can't recommend this cafe to anyone, not until they clean up their act and run this place a little more responsibly.
