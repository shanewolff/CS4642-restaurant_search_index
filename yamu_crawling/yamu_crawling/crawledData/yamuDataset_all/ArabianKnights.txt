yamu_review: ['Arabian Knights, along with the likes of ', ", has long been one of Colombo's Middle Eastern staples. It's tough being an Arabic restaurant here, but AK has held strong and we've become progressively bigger fans\xa0over the years.", "If you've been following our reviews of Arabian Knights, you'd see that we weren't exactly blown away when we first reviewed their (at the time) new restaurant in Colpetty, though we loved their former branch on Marine Drive. That being said, over the past two years they've been constantly improving and have become one of our go-to delivery options. Middle Eastern restaurants in Colombo have had some unfortunately short stints, but AK has managed to anchor itself quite well. Their prices are comparable to that of Hazari's, which is to say that it's fairly reasonable considering the portion sizes so managing under Rs. 1200 is easily possible.", 'We started with the Vegetable Soup (Rs. 410) which was basically the most boring option on the menu (blame Kinita for picking it). I was actually expecting a light soup, but we were pleasantly surprised by what we got. This soup was super thick, close to a curry in terms of consistency and with a bunch of veges like carrots, potatoes, tomatoes and onions roughly chopped and thrown in. It was also packed with spices which gave it a very distinct flavour, with a undertone of what tasted like aniseed.', "The Cheese Sambosek (Rs. 660) is a sort of melted cheese-filled patty. If you're into gooey cheese-filled food, this will be right up your alley. It's a pretty straightforward dish, though the patty itself was a bit on the sweet side, which we found a bit odd. This comes with a garlic mayo dip which really enhances the flavour along with their light spicy and sweet tomato sauce.", "So the Hummus with Pine Nuts and Meat (Rs. 480) is technically a cold starter, but in reality it's\xa0a main since it's so filling. This, along with the beef fatteh at Hazari's are probably my two favourite hummus dishes in Colombo. The crunch of pine nuts offset the smooth and creamy texture of hummus brilliantly, while also adding that earthy flavour. I've had this around three times now, and the beef has been on point every single time. They also add a bit of sumac to the hummus which adds a very light tartness, all of it coming together beautifully.", "The Chicken Tagine with Rice (Rs. 640) is probably one of their more modest rice options. The rice is more or less just steamed basmati with a sprinkling of sumac on top. This dish is all about the chicken, and while it didn't blow our socks off, it was still flavoursome.", "The chicken tagine had a lot going on with carrots, capsicums, onions and tomatoes. While those did add variety to the dish, we felt that there just wasn't enough chicken in there which was a bummer since it was actually cooked well.", "The restaurant's got a slightly weird orange-yellow theme with blue cushioned furniture, along with hanging metallic ceiling lamps, which make for a rather incongruous look. This would usually bother me, but it oddly wasn't the case here. It's certainly not mainstream.", "The service at AK has generally been very solid, and except for a few minor lapses, they were pretty good this time as well. We dropped in for lunch during a time they were having a discount going, but\xa0few of the waiters were actually\xa0aware of it. Our second waiter was a lot more prepared and knew the menu by heart, so we didn't have issues there onwards. It was a pretty busy lunch service so our food took around fifteen minutes to get to the table, which was fine.", 'Arabian Knights have ironed out a lot of the kinks, and managed to maintain a good level of consistency over the past two years. The food is quite authentic and affordable with some real winners like their ', ' and hummus, which make for great delivery options.', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Arabian Knights has long been one of Colombo's Middle Eastern staples, with reasonable prices and strong flavours.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    After an initial hiccup, Arabian Knights has bounced back well.

It was so easy  to communicate with them beforehand to have everything arranged. And I also emphasized we wanted the food served as soon as possible since we were going to arrive very hungry after a adventurous day. The service was  quick, waiters and the manager was so polite and helpful. The food tasted amazing! We were very happy with them :)\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    ordered delivery Extra nan Bread was not cooked just pale colour.meat did not had   BBQ taste as expected.Hommus shawrma had less meat than shown in pictures not too keen in ordering delivery. \n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Ifthar meal is a steel for rs.1,350/= per head.
