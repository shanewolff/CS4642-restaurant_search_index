excerpt: A cozy bistro serving excellent coffee and multi-cuisine comfort food.
yamu_review: ["Located on Flower Road\xa0near Ladies' College, The Embazzy\xa0is a cozy, handsome bistro serving one of the better coffees in town. We dropped in on a rainy day and had a wonderful experience.\xa0", 'They have an interesting menu with multi-cuisine options like South African fast food, Chinese fried rice, Jamaican jerk chicken burger and Australian Parma. Aside from that, they have the usual like pasta, waffles, risotto, fish and\xa0chips and of course, all day breakfast.\xa0', 'The Eggs Benedict (Rs. 1400) was phenomenal. They were nice enough to replace the chicken with avocado for a vegetarian. The egg\xa0was perfectly poached with a runny yolk. The hollandaise sauce was thick and gooey with a strong taste of the yolk. The base was a delicious burger bun with a tinge of sweetness. I wish there had been more avocado though, but overall, it was a party in my mouth. Everything blended so well together.', "The waffles (Rs. 350) with maple syrup (Rs. 150) and strawberries (Rs. 150) were quite decent. It certainly could have improved in terms of the batter which tasted very doughy. However, it wasn't overly sweet which is always a good thing.", 'The Kochichi Cheese Toast (Rs. 350) was again a delightful surprise. The nai miris\xa0was exactly the spiciness that I crave and loaded with a generous amount of mozzarella, it was very satisfactory. The bread was freshly baked and well toasted.', "For dessert, we tried the Passion Fruit Cheesecake (Rs 450) which was really good. The filling was cheesy and less sugary which is always a plus for me. The citric\xa0taste of the coulis helped balance out the density of the filling. It's a good dessert to try if you're not the biggest sweet tooth.", "We have to give a special shoutout to their coffee. It is incredible! I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that whatever coffee you get, it will wow you. Aside from that, they have also got fresh juices, healthy juices, milkshakes, tea and frappes.\xa0The coffee is freshly ground onsite and they use Lavazza Gold Selection.", 'The Cafe Mocha (Rs. 460) was our favorite. That was some excellent coffee! The mocha was strong with a chocolatey taste. It was thick and creamy and the added whipped cream blended well with the coffee. We suggest you try it without sugar.\xa0', "The White Hot Chocolate (Rs. 490) sounded interesting so we gave it a try. Needless to say, it was fantastic! It tasted like warm white chocolate with milk. It was mildly sweet. If you're not a white chocolate fan, you should probably stay away.\xa0", 'Their service too was nothing short of excellent with smiles all around and courteous attitude. Our food was served within a few minutes and they even requested our input as for any improvements.\xa0', 'The place is spacious and the ambiance gives a unique atmosphere of being inside a colonial house with modern furnishing. We loved everything about it, especially the peace and quiet which makes you want to stick around just a little longer.', "It's safe to say that we'll be going back for their coffee very soon. It instantly became one of our favorites. We highly recommend that you try them out.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    A cozy, handsome bistro serving one of the best coffees in town.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හතු පිපෙනවා වගේ මතු වෙන කොළඹ කැෆේ රැල්ලේ අලුත් ම එක තමයි එම්බසි බිස්ට්\u200dරෝ එක.\n                                                                                                                            ']
