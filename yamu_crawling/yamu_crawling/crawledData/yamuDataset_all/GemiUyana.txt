excerpt: A buth kade serving decent packs throughout lunchtime.
yamu_review: ["Gemi Uyana first opened up in Panadura, but now they have an outlet right opposite McDonald's on Galle Road. They have been fully operational for a few months so we decided to pay them a visit.", 'While it looks like your average buth kade with the curries on display, unfortunately, you cannot pick your curries, only the protein. There are only about 4-5 curries at a time and you will be served\xa04 of their choice.', 'We got the Chicken Rice and Curry (Rs. 230) which came with ', ', dhal and ', ". The dish was at best only average. The rice was good so there's nothing special to mention here. The curries were decently prepared but they could have used a bit more seasoning.

The chicken, however, was spicy and delicious enough that it\xa0saved the dish.', 'The Cuttlefish Rice and Curry (Rs. 280) had the same curries except for a ', ' instead of ', '.

It was decent, and for 50 bucks, I'd say pretty solid.", 'Their service can certainly improve because we found ourselves waiting in line for a good 15 minutes, at least. The could use more manpower, especially considering the wave of hungry customers they get during the lunch rush.', "The place is spacious but it is congested, especially the small dining room inside for the lack of proper ventilation. The wooden chairs and tables are not the most comfortable, but it's not like you plan to spend hours here.\xa0", 'We suggest that you stick to white rice here and also, takeout is your best bet.\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Another buth kade serving some decent rice and curry. \n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    අවසාන වශයෙන්\xa0ප්\u200dරනීත, ලන්තෑරුම, උදුම්බරා, ජාඩි සමඟ ගමේ කෑම වගේ බත් කඩවල් එක්ක සලකලා බැලුව ම නම්, ගැමි උයනේ තත්ත්වය මීට වඩා දියුණු වෙන්න ඕනේ කියලා කියන්න ම වෙනවා. \n                                                                                                                            ']
