excerpt: Sri Lanka’s favourite submarine is probably that at Dinemore. This fast food franchise has been around for quite a while, and by the looks of it they’ve expanded and opened up many more restaurants in Colombo, Kandy and even expanding internationally by branching out into the beautiful islands of the Maldives.
