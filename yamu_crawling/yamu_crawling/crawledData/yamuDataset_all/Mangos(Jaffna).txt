Their rice lunch is incredible. Great value for money and very tasty. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    ^^OOPS mistook this place for Cosy's. I haven't been to Mangos.

Ask for Wimalraj, humble waiter guy. Great food, great ambience. \n                                            ']
