name: Green Cabin
excerpt: Providing the city with crispy white hoppers and tongue burning katta sambol for well over 60 years, Green Cabin is one of Colombo's older, more venerable eating establishments.
yamu_review: ['Green Cabin is one of those restaurants that has been around for the longest time. I decided to hop in one Sunday afternoon for their “Sunday Special”, as they are known for their rice & curry buffet.', 'The Sunday Special offers two types of rice (red rice and white rice, duh!), four vegetable curries, two sambols (', ' and ', '), chutney, dried fish ', ' \xa0and good old papadam. If you cannot let a meal go by without meat, you can choose from their curries (fish, chicken and pork), but for an additional charge.', 'The vegetable curries that were on the buffet were some rice and curry classics – yellow curried lentils\xa0(basically, dhal), tempered beans, breadfruit kirata, more often known as dhel and stuffed ', '.\xa0The ', ' was one I was rather skeptical about because I am not all about the fancy veggies.', 'With true Lankan spirit, I piled my plate up with every single thing on the buffet and ordered a chicken curry because rice and curry without chicken is like a chocolate biscuit pudding without cashew nuts.', 'The curries were cooked with the competence that has helped Green Cabin stay up and running for the past few decades. The dhal was neither too runny, nor was it too thick.', 'The breadfruit kirata (dhel) did live up to its name as the creaminess of the coconut milk was very apparent, \xa0cutting through the tangy taste of the stuffed pathola, which I must admit was something I’d try again. Kudos to Green Cabin for not overcooking the tempered beans, and which retained\xa0their\xa0crunch.', 'Preparing', 'and ', ', let’s face it, is not a Byzantine task. So, obviously, nothing could go wrong in that avenue. However, what was slightly disappointing was that the ', ' wasn’t very crispy. All you papadum lovers out there know it’s a mighty problem when your ', ' does not let out that oomph-y crunch. #FoodWorldProblems', 'The chicken curry was satisfactory, and\xa0did blend in well with the dried fish which added some salty zing.', 'The Sunday Special was indeed very special with kiri pani as the dessert of the day.', 'Despite being a favorite among many, kiri pani does not really appeal to me, but I did take a few bites of\xa0it. It was good, so good that I took a few more bites. It was the treacle – it was sweet enough to down a little bit of the sourness from the curd. \xa0Since Sunday is the day for extra pounds on your body,\xa0I opted for a piece of caramel pudding too.', 'This, ladies and gentlemen, is one you must have even if diabetes stops you.\xa0', '\r\nIt was creamy and rich with the perfect shade of brown on top. Definitely worth every single cent of my 175 rupees!', '\xa0', 'Given that this was a buffet, the need for waiters was partially eliminated. We were entertained by an employee in the kitchen who was probably practicing for Sirasa Super Star.', "If you’re the type that doesn't enjoy loud, unexpected singing, this might come off as unprofessional. To me, it was just hilarious. The rest of the staff laughed along which made the whole experience very warm.\xa0", '\r\nI wasn’t made to wait too long for my dessert. So, +1 for that.', '\xa0', '\r\nThe rice and curry is not very budget-friendly, especially if you’re used to having a buth packet for Rs. 200. The veggie version is priced at Rs. 580 and chicken would cost you an additional Rs.\xa0210.\xa0', '\r\n', '\r\nOverall, Green Cabin serves decent rice and curry complete with a sweet course and ample seating. While it’s slightly high on the price spectrum for basic rice and curry,\xa0if you are in the mood for some good Lankan on a Sunday afternoon, you might want to check it out.\xa0', '\xa0', '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    One of Colombo's oldest and most nostalgic dining spots.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Providing the city with crispy white hoppers and tongue burning katta sambol for well over 60 years, Green Cabin is one of Colombo's older, more venerable eating establishments.\n                                                                                                                            ", "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Providing the city with crispy white hoppers and tongue burning katta sambol for well over 60 years, Green Cabin is one of Colombo's older, more venerable eating establishments.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    දිව දවන කට්ට සම්බල් සමග රසට හැපෙන ආප්ප පිරිනමන ග්\u200dරීන් කැබින් හැට වසකට අධික කාලයක් තිස්සේ කොළඹ තිබෙන සම්භාවනීය බොජුන්හලක්. එය ගෙදර හැදූ ආකාරයේ ලාංකික ආහාරවලට විශේෂිත තැනක්. ආච්චිගේ චිකන් කරිය වැනි දීසි එහි තිබෙනවා. ඔබේ කුස්සියට පිටතින් දේශීය භෝජන සංග්\u200dරහයක් වෙනුවෙන් විදේශිකයකු එක්කගෙන යාමට කොළඹ හොඳම තැන ග්\u200dරීන් කැබින්.\n                                                                                                                            ']
