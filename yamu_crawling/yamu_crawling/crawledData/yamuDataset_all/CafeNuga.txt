name: Cafe Nuga
excerpt: A healthy organic spot with a wide range of delicious dishes.
yamu_review: ["Nuga opened up a few months ago and we've been hearing nothing but good things about it, and this time around we're happy to say that they all turned out to be true. The place is superb! Everything is healthy, organic and delicious. It's also vegetarian/vegan-friendly, which is always a plus point.", "Nuga impressed us right off the bat with a varied menu that covered a whole range of dishes. One thing we found very refreshing was the fact that almost all the mains have a vegan or vegetarian option, which isn't the case even at most health-food restaurants. Besides that, they've got pasta, sandwiches, rice, burgers, and salads.", "The Seafood Pasta (Rs. 1080) was fettuccine\xa0combined with seafood\xa0in a red sauce tossed with\xa0local herbs and olives. There was plenty of seafood to go around and the pasta was well cooked with the sauce adding just the right amount of heat. They've used organic pasta and the sauce itself wasn't as heavy as the ones we have tried before. Overall, it was excellent.\xa0", 'We also got the Peking Tofu Roll (Rs. 700) which was grilled tofu, cucumber, sweet potato and lettuce wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla. As you can tell, this is a vegan dish and the tofu was really good with a grilled skin and tender center. There was very little in terms of sauce which we actually preferred, but as with most wraps, stuff tends to fall off mid way through. Tha being said, the overall texture and flavours were on point.', "The Smoothie Bowl (Rs. 600) we got was listed under smoothies but as per the ever popular Insta trend, we didn't drink it, we ate it. It was essentially a banana and raw honey blended smoothie base topped with mango, pineapple, strawberries, granola and chia seeds. The banana and honey base was amazing with a perfect texture that holds form in the bowl, but just melts in your mouth. The fresh fruits, chia and granola further added to the cocktail of textures, making this a perfect healthy dessert option.", "\xa0For drinks they've got smoothies (the ones that come in a glass), juices, iced tea, and coffee. Having tried the smoothie bowl, we decided to mix things up and try out the coffee. You can opt for almond milk if you want but it will be 20% more than the price mentioned.\xa0", "The Cappucino (Rs. 420) was decent. Because of the almond milk, it didn't have the thick texture we were normally used to but it was still tasty. There was a slightly burnt taste to it which can be easily overlooked. The cookies seemed to be homemade and went really well with the coffee.", "Their service was excellent. The staff was friendly and accommodating from the moment we arrived. They're all well-versed and seemed to know their way around the menu and our food arrived within 10-15 minutes.", "The place is really beautiful and spacious with heaps of natural light seeping through. You can literally sit anywhere and get the perfect Instagram pictures.\xa0 The wooden furniture, the green walls, and the glass windows; it doesn't take much to assume that the idea is to give an outdoor experience from the inside, and it works.\xa0", 'They also have coconut based products for sale as well like coconut butter, kithul treacle, coconut oil etc. Along with organic pasta, pasta sauce, organic tea and so on.', 'We honestly could not find any faults at Nuga. The food was excellent and we hope that they keep up with the same standards as they expand. We highly recommend you try this place. Your diet is safe here.\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Everything is healthy, organic and delicious.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    හෙල්ති විදියට ඔර්ගැනික් කෑම වේලක් කන්න කියාපු තැනක් තමයි මේ නුගා එක. \n                                                                                                                            ']
