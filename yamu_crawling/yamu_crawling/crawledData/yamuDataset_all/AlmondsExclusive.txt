name: Almonds Exclusive
excerpt: Almonds is the mysterious new restaurant on Galle Road. We stopped by to see what all the hullabaloo was.
yamu_review: ["There's a building in Galle Road that's a bit mysterious. Not because it's pretty much all-glass, no, but it's been nameless for a while.", '\r\nThe inside, is decorated with a ton of glass bulbs suspended from the ceiling, nude, beige and black tones for furniture and decor. It practically screams fine-dining and judging by their website, the food looks rich and expensive. What we had was alright.', 'The Cream of Chicken Soup (Rs. 670) is more of a chowder, with a few bits and pieces of chicken added to it.', '\r\n', "\r\nThe good thing here is that the soup is really flavourful and you only need the chicken as an add on or to enhance texture. Initially, the minuscule amount of chicken bothered me, but since the flavour was on point, it didn't really matter.\xa0\xa0", "The Monster Croissant (Chicken: Rs. 650) is a literal, gigantic croissant, sliced in half with a filling of your choice. It's served with fries and\xa0a minuscule helping of salad.\xa0", '\r\nThe chicken filling was tasty, with obvious hints of mayonnaise seeping through.', '\r\n', "\r\nThe croissant was a colossal, carb-filled Leviathan, that took a bit of effort to dig into. It isn't as flaky as its normal sized counterpart, which means it's like eating a large bun with buttery layers.\xa0", "\r\nThe salad was about a mouthful's worth that didn't really bedazzle us. The fries were crisp, a light gold and well salted.\xa0", '\r\n', "\r\nI'm really not exaggerating when I say it's large, and fair warning to those of you willing to try it; take a friend with you.", "The Strawberry Swiss Roll (Rs. 590) was a bit of a puzzle. It looks like a swiss-roll-upside-down-cake. With the swiss rolls placed at the top and a layer of strawberry pudding at the bottom. It was alright, but the flavour was mild and reminiscent of faluda\xa0(probably because of the rose essence). This isn't a bad thing, but it isn't great either. It just is.\xa0", "The juices were the best part about this entire experience, really. They're hands down the freshest juices you'll find on the Colpetty stretch. You're basically sipping on fresh fruit.", '\r\n', "\r\nWe initially placed an order for Mango Juice, but they brought out the Orange Juice (Rs. 490). It was too hot to squabble so we settled instead. Surprisingly enough the orange was a good choice. It was incredibly fresh with absolutely zero pulp and wasn't diluted with hefty amounts of water.\xa0", '\r\n', "\r\nThe Watermelon Juice (Rs. 490) was just as fresh and sweet. The sugar wasn't overpowering and it did a great job at cooling us down.\xa0", "They've stuck to a very stark, modern theme here with textured concrete walls, lots of wood accents and yellow lighting. There's a live station where mostly everything's obscured from view so unless you're really keen, you can't watch the chefs work.\xa0", "The waiters are excellent and we were constantly checked on to the point where we had to nod weakly with some hope of making\xa0them understand that 'yes, the food was good.'", "The restaurant itself is stellar, and at night the place is lit up with all those bulbs hanging from the ceiling. There's an upstairs section which was still under renovation when we visited. There's enough room for about 50 people to dine comfortably.", "\r\nOne annoying thing you'll face is that when the sun's setting, the entire place is awash with light, so if you're sitting by the windows, you can expect a tan or a sunburn. The Colombo sun is treacherous, so maybe take an umbrella with you if you're dining at 1 PM-5 PM.", "They've got premium stuff like duck and lamb albeit only one dish for each. Their menu also extends from Arabian cuisine to a variety of grilled meats, so be sure to ask them to take you through it all.", "\r\nThey're still very new, so here's hoping our next visit could meet with a few improvements.\xa0", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Almonds is a fairly classy restaurant down Galle Road. We dropped by to see what the hype was.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ලොකු බජට් එකක් වියදම් කරන්න බලාගෙන මිසක්, මෙතැන තෝරගන්න එපා කියලයි අපි නම් කියන්නේ. \xa0\n                                                                                                                            ']
user_reviews: ['\n                                            I dropped by after suggestions made by friends but it was just downright disappointing. Despite the ambience and the staff attention the food was inedible. My chicken pasta was dry and drowning in solidified cream that overpowered the whole dish. And the chicken was a no show on my plate. ', '\nMy family was joined by another, a herd of mosquitoes at our dinner table. \n                                    ', '\n                                            One of the most useless places ever! Insane prices for totally worthless food and drinks. Never gonna step in there again!\n                                    ', '\n                                            "Almonds" calls itself a "Fine Dining" Restaurant but in reality it’s a religious extremist establishment; It don’t serve alcohol or pork. And as if that isn’t bad enough they go even further and don’t even allow diners to bring in their own alcohol.  But there is no signage outside to warn unsuspecting Diners of what they are walking into.', '\n', '\nSo if you do go there, be prepared to have a dry meal with a milk shake or juice at Rs. 500 bucks + for a glass – the price you pay for a glass of imported wine elsewhere.', '\n', '\nThe menu is extremely limited and its basically beef and chicken. The prices are exorbitant and much higher than even the five-star hotel prices. Even the lowly pastas are Rs 1,300 here for a small single serve and Beef Lasagna is Rs. 2,700/-  For the price of each dish here, you can eat an entire buffet at the GOH or elsewhere in Colombo with starters, salads, soups, full range of quality meats, desserts, coffee and also be very satisfied with the meal. Not so at Almonds.', '\n', "\nThe frontage of the restaurant is a high glass wall. It separates the Galle Road from the restaurant but brings in all the strong afternoon sun and makes the place very hot. There are quite a few reserved parking bays in front. The inner wall has a large window of sorts, somewhat like a fish tank. Through that window you can see the upper torso and white hats of the cooks, but the cooking itself can’t be seen. That's probably deliberately obscured.", '\n', '\nThe tables are four seaters, but the seats are double seats. Which means you cannot move your seat in any direction without first asking for permission from your guests. These double seats are far too low anyway and it is extremely difficult to sit back or even lean forward and reach the food on the table without stretching.  The seating looks classy, but they are very impractical and uncomfortable and designed just for the look. There are flies flying around in the restaurant and probably many more in the kitchen. The toilets are at the back and they are filthy !', '\n', '\n"Almonds" might have got away with their sky-high ridiculous prices if the quality of their food was good. But their food is terrible. The texture of the chicken and beef betrays their long incarceration in freezers. The beef is supposed to be Australian, and hence the high prices, but it is as tough as the cheapest cuts of local beef.  On top of the already high menu prices they also add a further 10% to the bill as Service Charge. Whether that 10% Service Charge is given to the staff or not, is a matter for the Labour department to check.', '\n', '\nA section of the restaurant is a snack bar selling pastries, cakes and coffee. The pastries are stone cold, and the Cakes are Rs. 600/- to 800/- a slice but didn’t look good enough to justify the stiff price tags. The Croissants used for the sandwiches aren’t crispy, flaky or fresh. They are poor imitations, an apology for a Croissant. ', '\n', '\n"Almonds" is one of the most expensive places in Colombo even for coffee. A cup or rather a glass of coffee costs over 600 bucks. And the coffee too is bad –too light, bitter and aroma less.\n                                    ']
