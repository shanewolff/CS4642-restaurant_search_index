yamu_review: ["Let's Brunch is a pop-up brunch spot that time shares a space with ", "just down Haig Road (Marine Drive). It's a popular joint\xa0with a menu that serves up\xa0international\xa0as well as\xa0local fusion spinoffs- like their Cinnamon Apple Waffles and Sri Lankan style crepes with ", '.', "We got a portion of the Eggs Benedict (Rs. 695) with crab on the side for an extra Rs. 295, slyly called The Cumberbatch. Much to our chagrin, we were told that they didn't have English Muffins available so the eggs would be served atop a slice of multi-grain bread which makes the price seem rather exorbitant unless the bread was home-made (it wasn't).", "\r\nThe eggs were poached excellently, with a perfectly runny yolk and were topped off with an adequate amount of tart hollandaise sauce. The crab,\xa0however, was intensely spicy for my taste and with the afternoon heat, wasn't a smart choice. Served alongside the eggs and bread was half a grilled tomato and two potato fritters.\xa0Does it taste as good as my man Benny C? No.", "The Classical French Toast (Rs. 725) comes with a side of maple syrup, topped with strawberries. Aside from being absolutely delicious, this made for a pretty sight to behold so if you live on Instagram\xa0I'd suggest you put a picture up so you can garner all those likes.", "\r\nThe toast was well done, and paired with the maple syrup it's basically good enough to make your tastebuds cry. The strawberries make a sweet addition to the whole dish, so you get an occasional tart kick out of it.", "We tried to opt for the cocktails, but they weren't available. Instead, we got a beetroot concoction creatively called The Beets (Rs. 525) which is also infused with carrot, apple and ginger. It's really thick and the beetroot is very dominant which makes drinking a little uncomfortable when you take a sip and you have chunks of beetroot chilling on your tonsils. Taste-wise, the sharp apple flavour paired with ginger is super refreshing although the carrot doesn't really do much.", "\r\nThe Lime Juice (Rs. 425) is honestly a sham because it's a glass of freshly squeezed lime juice for a ridiculous price. The balance of lime and water is fine, but the price\xa0just isn't justified.", 'Lots of wood, a magnificent view of Marine Drive, and the sea and the breeze taking your hair for a ride; what else can you ask for? \xa0The focal point of the decor has to be long line of interesting posters they have up by the cashier. Very camera-friendly.', '\r\nThey also have pots full of meringues and adult colouring pages that serve as table mats which only adds to the charm.', 'Aside from being a little cruel on the wallet, they still serve quality food. I recommend this place if you just got paid and want to celebrate; especially with a juicy gossip sesh.', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Let's brunch shares a location with The Fat Crab and as the name suggests; offers an excellent brunch menu. \n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Full English Breakfast, full Sri Lankan view.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    බ්\u200dරන්ච් අත්දැකීම ලබපු, නොලබපු ඕනෙම කෙනෙක් යන්නම ඕනේ තැනක් විදියට “Let’s Brunch” එක හඳුන්වන්න පුළුවන්. කෑම, බීම විතරක් නෙවෙයි, මෙතැන වාතාවරණය පවා හරිම සුන්දරයි.\n                                                                                                                            ']

Can't wait to go again !! \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Read this review while digesting after being to Let's  Brunch. Definitely loved the table decor. Agree that staff need to be better versed on menu, poor waiter was struggling to answer my questions until I eventually suggested he ask someone who was more comfortable with the dishes to come over.  The drinks definitely need work. The mimosa was flat and the juice a bit off. Had a soured aroma and the thick slices of ginger floating on top made it difficult to drink easily.  My hopes of a boozy brunch spot were squashed. We tried the baked brie (I specifically asked the lady if it was a whole wheel baked in pastry--which is what is to be expected when calling a item 'baked brie pastry'. What arrived, was actually a pastry filled with chutney and bits of brie rind. I've made baked brie, in pastry and filo dough. I know what it's supposed to look like. This is not it. So unless you love chutney and pastry stay away. In their defense the pastry was very good.), French toast (average, nothing special but tasty. Could be elevated with some sliced fruit/more strawberries to add some acidity and balance to the dish) and eggs Benedict with spicy crab ( eggs poached to perfection, hollandaise sauce pretty good, spicy crab was not spicy enough and the fried potatoes hash was not bad, just a bit too dry. I think this dish is better plated on a flat plate or board as the sides of a bowl make it difficult to maneuver and cut things up as there are so many components.).  Overall, all the dishes we tried were one note and nothing special. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    visited this place today…I'm not sure if it was just for us, but the quantities were extremely less. It was very disappointing! I ordered waffles which was Rs 720, and what I got was 6 thin (small sized) slices of waffles served in a huge plate  topped with like 3-4 slices of strawberries…It wasn't enough and was not worth at all… It was the same for my friends as well. TBH we wanted to ask if this it or any more waffles to come", '\r\n', '\r\nI do not recommend this place to anyone.\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    this is is a genuinely pretty establishment aside from the location. went there on a sat morning and was greeted by a very agitated grumpy looking lady. firstly they took ages to take our order and got both our orders for coffee incorrect by giving us tea instead. When correcting her she almost has a disbelieving face on her as if theres NO WAY she could have possibly gotten our order wrong. this was also on the back of ordering a bottle of water from three different chaps and waiting a solid 20 minutes for it to come.', '\r\n', '\r\nthe food was very average considering the steep prices and i left with room to eat more. not that it was bland, but it was nothing unique from anything i could have hurriedly put together at home. Bill took another 15 minutes to put together from three people by the looks of it and additional the bad service seemed to be experienced by everyone there which made me think it might have just been a bad day. However being in the market for about 8 months now is more than enough time to have all the kinks ironed out.', '\r\n', "\r\nTotal damage came to 5k+ for 2.
