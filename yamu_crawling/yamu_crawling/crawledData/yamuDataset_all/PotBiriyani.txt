name: Pot Biriyani
excerpt: If you're having people over and don't want to cook or just having a family meal, we highly recommend Pot Biriyani for takeaway or delivery. It's run by a friendly family and they make tasty, well presented and generous biriyani, among other things.

This time, the food wasn't up to the mark and delivered to us very late as they shipped the food late. We cannot tolerate keeping people hungry after inviting them for a lunch. Again, Paneer wasn't good last time when we ordered food for a value more than 35k. Egg was missing in biriyani. Whole array of issues. Please do not take orders if you cannot meet the quality. Anyway, that was the last business to you guys from our organization and friends. \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Don't Waste your money……really disappointed \n                                            ", "\n\n                                    Last time I tried these guys' pot biriyani at a friend's house there were nuts, egg and coriander on top. There were also big chunks of chicken inside the biriyani pot (aside from the roast chicken given separately). I ordered a large chicken and large prawn biriyani and a smaller vegetarian biriyani the week but I was pretty let down.  There was no egg. No raita. I got maldive fish sambol, green peas and a malay pickle of sorts. When asked later why this is, I was told that since they haven't increased their price in a long time, they have now forgone some of these items, such as egg. And while I was initially told that for the 2 biriyanis there would be 16 pieces of chicken, they changed their story later to say they put 750g of chicken. How accurate this is, I have no way of testing. The fact that they don't now put egg and so much chicken is a lie because just last week another friend had ordered from them, and they said there was plenty chicken and egg. So it appears their service is inconsistent. Best have a stern conversation when placing the order in order to get what exactly you expect, maybe even at a higher price. The portions are gigantic. About 12 people can have this 8 person pot.\n                                            ", '\n\n                                    The food is alright but very poor customer care!The person at the desk (?owner) was quite rude and arrogant and very unprofessional!Unfortunately i had run out of time and did not have any other option…no more pot biriyani from this place again!\n                                            ', '\n\n                                    Food is alright but customer care is nil!!The person at the desk was quite rude and arrogant and had very unprofessional use of language!

We had to wait for 5 mts to collect our order but that\'s understood compared to other caterers where people have to wait for more than 30 mts. Customer care - no issues. Waznie, a small request, appreciate if you could add potatoes in the biryani.

As mentioned in some of comments here, the pot of 8 is enough for 10. The rice tasted OK but the some parts of the chicken in the rice was burnt. There was no sultanas and cashew nuts  or potato in the rice. Was disappointed in not seeing any Eggs or Raita/Curd Sambol as shown in the photos here(also in mentioned in your review). The green peace curry lacked cashew nuts and there was no pineapple which is I look forward to.

I had it home delivered & one container of Malay pickle & maldive fish was missing. This was very disappointing because 12 of us had to share one portion of Malay pickle & maldive fish when there should have been 2 of each. There were no cashews in the green pea curry, very little raisins in the rice & didn't find any cashew in the rice either. There was no onion riata nor any eggs. However, the food tasted good. But without adequate Malay pickle to go with was very disappointing. Pls check when sending home deliveries to ensure all the items are packed. \n                                            "]
