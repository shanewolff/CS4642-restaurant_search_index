name: Cafe Kumbuk
excerpt: Simple and healthy, Kumbuk does everything right with local, seasonal and organic ingredients. 
yamu_review: ["With a minimal aesthetic and a focus on local, organic and seasonal produce, Cafe Kumbuk serves up some quality food at a beautiful location. Tucked inside Horton Place, they share a space with Prana Lounge in an old colonial home. It's a great place to go unwind, read a book, sip on a smoothie and while away the hours. They've got tea, coffee, and some of the best juices you'll find in Colombo. They've also got a seasonal menu sampling from Asian and European cuisines.", "The menu isn't too extensive at Kumbuk, but there's\xa0good variety on offer. We like that they don't confine themselves to any particular cuisine, and that doesn't mean they're into fusion, either. They just do a few dishes, sampling from different cuisines, making use of local produce. The results are quite good.", "I had the vegan option which was Sweet Potato, Chick Pea And Pumpkin Curry with Naan (Rs 650) and it was quite filling, easily feeding two. If you're not vegan, they'll add curd to top off the curry and butter to the naan.\xa0There's a lot of flavour going on, and the paprika brings in just enough heat, with the curd giving it a nice, tart kick. I brought some back to the office and Bhagya found it to be really flavourful.\xa0", "We checked out the specials board, which listed Vietnamese Sea Bass (Rs 900). It was also recommended by the staff,\xa0and we're glad we went with it. What's important to note about the fare at Kumbuk is that they're all about healthy living, so that means it's not overly seasoned. The palate that they cater to is quite subtle. For example, with the sea bass, it's not masked with washes of oil that would otherwise make for a tasty dish. Instead, what you taste is the freshness of the fish, which is a treat in itself.", "The rice was just lightly peppered and could have been softer. The purple cabbage was pretty on the plate. We enjoyed the mango salsa that came with as it wasn't too tart or sweet. The cilantro brought together the flavours really well. It's a simple touch, but it worked.", "I had the Island Chiller (Rs 300) which is pretty much a watermelon juice with thambili. It's garnished with some rosemary and looks lovely. Hands down, this is the best watermelon juice I've had. The coconut water really rounds out the flavour, adding a delicate sweetness to it that's quite tasteful.\xa0", "The Kumbuk Colada (Rs 420) is a pretty distinct smoothie. Using coconut milk and coconut water as well as desiccated coconut, the smoothie also includes strawberries and pineapple. I didn't get much of the strawberry, but the pineapple and coconut water worked well together. You get a creaminess that isn't too overwhelming, and a coconut aftertaste. It's not too sweet\xa0either.", "Without doing much, Kumbuk has done a lot to make the space their own. We've been to this space before when it hosted a musical event, and the vibe is just completely different. There's a lot of natural light coming in and plenty of ventilation thanks to the high ceilings. If you dislike air conditioning but you still want a cool environment, this is the place for you.", "We found the place to be quite chilled out, even though it was packed when we got there. The ambience meant we\xa0didn't mind the wait as our food was being prepared.", "The staff at Kumbuk are quite accommodating. Everyone's friendly and you feel quite welcome. You have to place your order at the counter, and then they'll bring your order out to your table.\xa0", "Kumbuk promises a seasonal menu that ought to keep us coming back for more. It's got a distinct and charming character that you could easily warm up to, and we're actually quite impressed to find out that this is the realization of its owner's university project. You can tell that there's thought put into each detail. The prices are quite reasonable and you can dine for around Rs 1200 per head. For the location, fare and care that is taken, we think it's fair.\xa0", '\xa0', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Kumbuk does some of the best juices you'll find in Colombo.

I’ve tried many of their dishes including breakfast, lunch & dinner options & all I can say is that it’s superb. Food always takes a looong time to arrive (roughly 30 mins at least) which can be really annoying.

Cafe was full of locals and expats… we snuck a seat at the communal table and waited for our meals. And waited. And waited. And waited. Watched 7 other customers arrive and order after us, and receive their meals before us, as they were also on the communal table and sitting beside us. Waited so patiently and was apologized to numerous time by the waiters for the looong wait, and that our meal was indeed coming… now I hardly call a quesadilla and chicken melt sandwich a gastronomic revelation of the culinary world requiring detailed skill and being so labor intensive to justify a 45minute wait, but alas, the food ordered after ours - grilled sea bass, salad bowls etc. did indeed look quite tasty and arrived piping hot to the tables, I was happy to sit in the stands anticipate a boundary hitting or clearing the fence from the batsmen in the kitchen….when our meal finally arrived, my first bite into my chicken sandwich went straight through to the keeper, where it sadly stayed. Because of the obvious mix up in the kitchen with orders, I can hypothetically conclude my sandwich had sat around for quite a while and done laps in and out of chef microwaves nuclear hands, repeatedly crucified beyond human consumption. I\'m one of those people who will sit with their tail between their legs in defeat and when asked \'hows my food\' I\'ll meekly reply \'fine\', but this sandwich was so incredible tough, it was like trying to chew a rubber chicken dog toy.  It was a health hazard to your teeth and gums, that I pushed it aside and got up to leave. My partner sensed I was unhappy and quickly offered to swap her quesadilla with me as it was my birthday, but when she tried tackling her first bite of the "freshly prepared sandwich to order", she quietly passed on the second bite. She proceeded to open the sandwich to salvage some of the warm chicken filling inside, but gave up the task of sifting through gristle and cartilage to find her lunch too daunting, and pushed it aside, defeated.', '\r\n', '\r\nNow what to do. Seeing the cafes policy of paying for your meal before you can decide for yourself whether in fact it is actually worth paying for, I was left in a dilemma. To either: A send it back and let them have another gastronomical crack at a "chicken sandwich" or B go up and ask for a refund; or C live and learn from your mistake and walk out (and write a review.) I took the latter option split the quesadilla with the missus and split.', '\r\n', '\r\n Five visits to this beautiful country in the past 9 years, never left a meal to go lonely once. Seeing it was social media that sold this meal unwillingly to me, I thought it only fair to sell it back.', '\r\n', "\r\nI love how far this country and its food scene has progressed in the past years, it's something that keeps me coming back in anticipation every time. I hope that this is not a sign of future things to come. Let the customer decide whether a  meal is worth paying for first, as also with the mandatory 10% service charge we now see everywhere. The rest of the culinary world allows this. ", '\r\n', '\r\nYou have been warned.

I have read and understood all you have said and passed it onto my team at both venues just to ensure this is not the case again. We now have a fantastic team who are working hard to ensure every dish that goes out of our kitchen is nothing but top quality and flavour - our new menu aims to showcase this properly! ', '\r\n', '\r\nAs for the payment, I can totally see where you are coming from as your meal was disappointing. I can only apologize for this and say if you ever decide to come back that we would love to offer you a proper meal on the house - one that is above expectation. ', '\r\n', '\r\nPlease note that we never ask anyone point blank to pay at the time they order, they are most welcome to sit - eat - and decide the rest.
