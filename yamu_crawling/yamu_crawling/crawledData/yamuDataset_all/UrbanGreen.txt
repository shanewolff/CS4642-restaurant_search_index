name: Urban Green
excerpt: Nice, cosy caf√© with nice, recycled furniture and a shaded terrace. 
yamu_review: ['Tucked away in a peaceful\xa0and verdant\xa0parallel street\xa0to Duplication Road,\xa0only few minutes walk away from Liberty Plaza and\xa0Kollupitiya buzz, Urban Green\xa0looks very inviting with its wooden upcycled furniture and large shaded terrace. The restaurant/caf√© caters for each and every need of the day and at\xa0very reasonable prices, which is pretty rare and much\xa0appreciated in this rather exclusive neighbourhood.', 'We dropped by at around 3pm\xa0on a lazy Sunday afternoon and were glad to hear that the lunch menu was still available at that time.', 'Parched after an urban stroll around\xa0Kollupitiya\xa0under a blazing sun and in great need of a caffeine kick after an eventful weekend, we happily spotted\xa0the\xa0iced coffee section in the menu and immediately ordered an Iced Cafe Latte (Rs. 420) and an Iced Americano (Rs. 380).\xa0', "The coffee they're using is a mild, light or medium roasted one. The brews are accordingly mild and easy to drink, which isn't unpleasant at all, unless you're feeling really down and need a powerful kick to wake up.\xa0", 'The iced latte was\xa0milky and mellow with a\xa0velvety and rich texture, as I like. The americano was very refreshing and\xa0invigorating but lacked a bit of depth.', 'Urban Green has widened its selection of food since our last visit and,\xa0in addition to short eats, sandwiches and cakes, now serves burgers, rice & curry, fried rice, salads and pastas for lunch and more elaborated mains as well as kottus for dinner.\xa0', 'They cook rice & curries for lunch during the week for Rs. 250. They also organise Jaffna nights on Wednesdays and BBQ or Kebab nights on Fridays, which\xa0sound\xa0pretty cool and affordable.', "The Fish Bun\xa0(Rs. 70), with curry leaves on top, looked very promising in the display case and didn't disappoint. The bread was fresh and soft and the generous filling very fishy (in a good way) and spicy.", 'With a copious Greek Salad\xa0(Rs. 400), it made a light and healthy meal or starter for bigger eaters. The salad mainly consisted of iceberg lettuce, cucumber, (a lot of) bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, olives\xa0and parmigiano. Not sure the Greeks would approve this twist. We would also have preferred the expected feta cheese, instead but it was still a decent salad that satisfied\xa0our need of freshness.', 'The\xa0Chicken Fried Rice (Rs. 400) was ordered by a friend of mine, an expert in the subject after years of fried rice tasting throughout the world. And was approved by him.\xa0It was nicely eggy and peppery and the considerable amount of fresh veggies added an interesting crunch to the moist rice. The only and quite big drawback was the chicken. It was undercooked in its center and the whole texture was very rubbery. Therefore, we safely left it on the side. It was not a good day to die from salmonella.\xa0', 'The Spicy Juicy Chicken Burger (Rs. 450)\xa0was more juicy than spicy. The chicken inside was grilled and properly cooked this time. The burger was loaded with bell peppers, which made the dish taste more like a Mexican fajita than an actual burger. The burger came with a small portion of potato wedges, that were well executed and spiced.', 'And finally, the French Fries (Rs. 250) were thin, nicely crispy\xa0and spiced. They disappeared from the plate in no time.', 'All in all, the food was pretty good but not mind blowing.', 'Urban Green did a great job in furnishing and decorating the place.\xa0', "Inside is very cosy and trendy with wooden walls, shelves, tables and Tolix looking chairs. The French window\xa0naturally lights up\xa0the counter and middle of the room and there's also a darker corner with a\xa0comfy looking couch to crash on and read\xa0the available newspapers and magazines.\xa0", 'The shaded and green terrace is spacious and has the same modern\xa0pallet wood upcycling theme going on.', "On this Sunday afternoon, they were playing ABBA Best Of in the background, which didn't really suit the contemporary look of the place but manage to put us in a festive mood.", 'Attentive and efficient. Food and drinks came quickly and the staff was regularly checking on our side to make sure our meal was running\xa0smoothly.', 'Urban Green dishes out some decent Western and Sri Lankan\xa0dishes\xa0and coffees at a fair price and in a cosy and laid back\xa0atmosphere.\xa0', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Caf√© that shuts out the hustling of Colombo while being in Colombo.\n                                                                                                                            ', "\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    Colombo's latest cafe that shuts out the hustling of Colombo while being in Colombo.\n                                                                                                                            ", '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ‡∂Ö‡∂ª‡∑ä‡∂∂‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∑ä\u200d‡∂ª‡∑ì‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂±‡∑ö ‡∂ö‡∑ú‡∑Ö‡∂π ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂± ‡∂ö‡∑ê‡∑Ü‡∑ö ‡∑É‡∂Ç‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑ò‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂ß ‡∂∏‡∑ì‡∂ß ‡∂Ö‡∑Ä‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂Ø‡∑ä‡∂Ø‡∂ö‡∂ß ‡∑Ñ‡∂∏‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂ö‡∂ß ‡∑Ä‡∂ú‡∑ö ‡∂ö‡∂Ω‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ë‡∂ö‡∂≠‡∑î ‡∑Ä‡∑î‡∂´‡∑î ‡∂≠‡∑Ä‡∂≠‡∑ä ‡∂≠‡∑ê‡∂±‡∂ö‡∑ä. ‡∂¥‡∂ª‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑ä ‡∂ë‡∂ö‡∂ß ‡∂Ω‡∑ú‡∂ö‡∑î ‡∂ú‡∑è‡∂´‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂≠‡∂ß‡∑ä‡∂ß‡∑î ‡∂±‡∑ú‡∑Ä‡∑ô‡∂± ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂ß, ‡∑Ñ‡∑ú‡∂≥ ‡∂ö‡∑ë‡∂∏ ‡∑Ä‡∑ö‡∂Ω‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂¥‡∑î‡∑Ö‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ö ‡∂≠‡∑ê‡∂±‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂ß ‡∂Ö‡∂¥‡∑ö ‡∂ö‡∑ì‡∂¥‡∂Ø‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ô‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂∏ ‡∂∏‡∑ö‡∂ö‡∂ß ‡∂ª‡∑ô‡∂ö‡∂∏‡∂Ø‡∑è‡∂ª‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂Ø‡∑ì‡∂Ω‡∑è ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∂‡∑î‡∂´‡∑è.\n                                                                                                                            ']

It‚Äôs value for money! Also they have very friendly staff. From the moment we walked in we felt at home. The manger was very friendly & kept on checking on us & all other customers.
