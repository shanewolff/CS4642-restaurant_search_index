yamu_review: ["The first time I called these guys up, they told me to 'come on over, everything's open!'\xa0", "\r\nEverything was not.\xa0Their opening times for each stall are scattered but they're slowly finding their footing.", "Everything here is under Rs. 400, which is superb. We thought we'd try something from each of their outlets but the only ones open were The Waffle\xa0Inc, Peeko, Meringue and ", '.', '\r\n', "The monsoon hadn't hit us yet when we went there so we decided to beat the heat with two cupfuls of flavoured ice.\xa0", '\r\nThe pink one there is "Sour Candy"; a mixture of their blackcurrant and lemon+lime flavoured syrups.\xa0', '\r\nThe neon concoction contains the same lemon+lime and passion fruit syrups including a small shot of mixed fruit syrup. It\'s called the "Mixed Madness".\xa0', "\r\nBoth of these tasted tart and were refreshing but the Sour Candy isn't as sour as I'd have liked it. I was expecting a more 'Centre Shock' style electrifyingly acetuous taste\xa0but alas.", "\r\nThey cost Rs. 200 for a regular cup (which is quite large) so I'll say it's a pretty good deal if you're looking for something to help cool you down.", '\r\n', "'The Waffle\xa0Inc.' has a few savoury waffles as well as sweet ones up for grabs. The guy manning the counter is really friendly and he'll ask you how you prefer your savoury waffles so tell him if you want them extra spicy.", '\r\nWe got a mild, Grilled Chicken waffle and at Rs. 300 it was not only cheap but it also had large chunks of chicken practically spilling off the sides.\xa0', '\r\nThe flavour was superb as well with the slightest hint of spice coming through. it was perfect because it had a ', " to it which didn't make it taste bland.\xa0", '\r\n', 'Okay so what blows my mind is that their Cookie Crunch waffle is ', ' Rs. 250. This monstrous slab of diabetes, topped with two hefty scoops of vanilla ice cream, sprinkled with nuts and topped off with two cookies as well as doused in chocolate sauce can be yours for Rs. 250.\xa0', "\r\nWe couldn't even finish the thing, it was that big.\xa0", '\r\nBoth waffles were top-notch. They were a\xa0beautiful golden brown, crispy on the edges and nice and soft on the insides.\xa0', "\r\nI'm really thankful that they aren't stingy with their toppings. If you're looking for good waffles, go here.", '\r\n', "We got a slice of 'Chocolate Ganache' from Meringue for Rs. 230. It was extremely dense, crumbly and rock hard (which is probably the only let down out of this whole experience). They're very very new though, so it might not be fair to pass such harsh judgement, but que Sarah Sarah.", "It's basically a gigantic tent that won't hold too well if there was a storm. White plastic chairs and tables are placed here and there for your comfort. There's also a bunch of large bean bags scattered about the place for people who think sitting on chairs is too mainstream.\xa0", "\r\nI like the fact that they didn't overthink their furniture because all the colour comes from the stalls and in case you missed it: magnificent murals by one of CMB's most talented artists-\xa0", '.\xa0', 'Everyone here is super friendly. The hosts will bring your food to your table if you conduct yourself in a courteous manner because they are hosts and not waiters. So be nice. Or something. Up to you.\xa0', "\r\nHOWEVER, I did notice one of the guys standing at an awkward angle with his phone propped up and every time I glanced in his direction he'd lower it. I'd straight up say he was taking pictures of us on the sly but I don't know for sure. If I do find a candid photo of me shoving waffles into my mouth somewhere on the internet I am not going to be happy.", "People seem to love this place as you can see from the quotes above. If you have a marker or something on you, you too can use the words 'good' and 'vibes' generously.", "\r\nI see this place becoming super-popular with families. However, I do hope this doesn't fall prey to the Shisha-Hounds the same way ", ' and ', ' did. If it does, they can say bye to their female clientele.\xa0', '\r\nApart from that, the food is cheap, the place is lively and the waffles are 10/10.', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    The Food Station is a collection of stalls that offer up some good grub.\n                                                                                                                            ', '\n                                                                                                                                    ', '\n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                    ‡∂ö‡∂≠‡∑è‡∑Ä ‡∂â‡∑Ä‡∂ª ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂ö‡∂Ω‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂∏‡∑ö‡∂ö‡∂≠‡∑ä ‡∂∏‡∂≠‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂± ‡∂ï‡∂±‡∑ö. ‡∑Ü‡∑î‡∂©‡∑ä ‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ß‡∑ö‡∑Ç‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ë‡∂ö‡∑ö ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂± ‡∑Ñ‡∑ê‡∂∏ ‡∂ö‡∑ë‡∂∏‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∂∏ ‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂Ω‡∑ä 400‡∂ß ‡∂Ö‡∂©‡∑î‡∂∫‡∑í. \n                                                                                                                            ']
